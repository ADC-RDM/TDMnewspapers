Coal Beneath’ the Narth Sea.

It-is often said that Britain owes
her commercial supremacy to her
coal. For her size she has more
and better coal than any other coun-
try In the world, and for steam pur=
poses South Wales practically sup-
plies the world:" Where did the coal
come from?

The coal seams, lying one below
another to an unknown depth, éand
not infrequently cropping out at the
surface, are sure proof that tropical
conditions once prevailed in the lati-
tude of these islands, In primaeval
times, a period whoke remoteness is
measured by millions of years, the
district which is now Britain was
connected with the continent, and the
coal of~“England doubtless rums un-
der ghe Channel and the southern
pagt of the North Sea, and is con-
tinued in the coalflelds of Northern
France, Belgium and Flanders,

All this region was fcovered thick
with great tree ferns, growingsto a
gigantic height, of "exceedingly rapid
growth, in the damp steaming heat
‘of a tropiral climate which exceeds
the heat of the equatorial regions of

slash and crescent pockets.
