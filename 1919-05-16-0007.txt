HE farmer with a Ford Truck
practically lives next door to
the market.

He has a choice of markets.
He becomes more independent.

He can market his goods when
and where he pleases.

He sells his erop to the very best
advantage.

And his hauling costs him less—
in labor and money.

It is not only cheaper to haul
with a Ford Truck than with a
team and wagon, it is quicker, it is
easier work.

Consider the time and labor the
/ farmer can save with a Ford Truck.
With a team the trip to town takes

the better part of a day.

STATESMEN CARICATURED.

Gargoyles on Parlinment Buildings
Cause Controversy,

Art clroles in Ottawa are in a per-
fect furore over the sculpture on the
new Parliament Buildings. A con.
troversy Is waging which {5 involv-
jg art critles, artists, architects,
gelptors and laymen,

Thotroublo 18 over the gargoyles
on the wi\dings. The buildings are
built in Gothf-architeeture and gar-
goyles, both fr and out, form natur-
ally a prominédt ‘enture of the de-
corations, Many ofthe Enpsayles in-
stead of being grot84ue animals and
floral ornaments & caricatures of
prominent Canadan Statesmen and
, public men,

The controvery started through a
paper read at tte recent meeting of
the Ottawa Tachers’ Institute hy
A. F. Newlanls, artist for the Ot-
tawa schools, in Which he condemned
in scathing lanjusge the Idea of gro-
tesque cprientu€8 of public men as
decorations forall time on the Par-
lament Buildings. Mr. Newlands de-
seribed the gawoyles depicting Sir
Robert Borden, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
the Duke of revonshire, the Duke
of Connaught, lon. William Pugsley
and other celewities as “disgusting
jokes,” Je ha been supported by
E. G. Fosbery, A.R.C.A., an Ottawa
artist, who degribes them as “mud-

ple faces: £4
John Pearson the chief architect

for the building has kept out of the
controversy, expt to point out that
the designs were? approved by a com-
mittee of leadn® Canadian artists,
He has been sipported in his con-
tention that thes are in keeping with
Gothic arcHiteciare by a number of
leading Ottawa artists and sculptors.
It is pointed.out that many old-world
churches in their gargoyles have even
caricatured leading ecclesiastics,
The sculptor responsible for the
work is - a widely-known English
artist, Walter J. Allen. He worked
on Durham, Salisbury and Win-
chester Cathedrals. Several years he
spent abroad swwdylng the French,
German and’ Spanish Gothic archi-
tecture, He has for years been look-
ed upon as an authority in England
on Gothic architecture.

Some of the gargoyles are so gro-
tesque that the caricatures are
scarcely recognizable, This is not
true of the heads representing the
Dukes of Connaught and Devonshire.
They adorn the corner of windows
outside the Senate block. The Duke
of Connaught’s nese is, perhaps, a
little ‘exaggerated and the same is
true of the moustaclie of the Duke
of Devonshire. Both express humor
and there i8 nething offensive ahout
the gargoyles. <The gargoyles repre-
senting Sir. Robert Borden, Sir Wil-
frid Laurfer, Sir John. A, Mdcdonald

probably from his frequent sunfming

In addition to leading statesmen
