Ladies’ Underwear
Perhaps long knit underwear was considered an uninter-
| esting necessary part of one's attire. Not so now. Manufactur-
| ors have learned that women love the most exquisite daintiness
and finest tailoring, trimmings, simple and attractive, on even
| so ordinary a garment as a knitted vest or union suit. |
