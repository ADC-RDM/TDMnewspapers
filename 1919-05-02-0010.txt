Mr: Baulch, of the Northern Electric
, System. discussed with the council the
' question of a fire alarm’ system for
the town. After inspecting Amherst
burg lie finds that two. systems lend
“themselves to this town. =

(1) The Banlch system, giving the
, location of .a fire in any part of the
town by means of street boxes equip
ped with mechanism . enabling it’ to
send in a different alarm for each
box. . This with a tapping equipment
degigned to work In connection with
these boxes and installed in the fire-
_ men's houses, and in conjunction with

“this incorporate mechanism operating
anselectric siren, replacing the preg
ont steam whistle.’ The estimated cost
of the 6-boxband 12 tap bell system
“with double siren, $1890. The siren
alone would cost about $1260, which

_ includes the necessary stations Lo turn

in the alarm.
The town bell system would run

close to "$2,600. ; we
~ “ Mr. Baulch, in angwer-to a question,
*, said the siren alarm would not include
an alarm at the Gordon wilterworks.

_ This would cost about $200 more.
"Boxes cost $85 each. Chunging the
‘ « tap bells from the firemen's houses
. would not be as much as changing a
“Yoldphone. Jt would take about sixty
daysito got tho oquipment oiit [ae

‘Mayor Park—“What should haye
been done was to have her brought

Mr. vavis, appearing on her behalf,
pleaded that the old lady is 90 years of
age and didn't have the money to make
the changes required. She had no

Mr. Laramie suggested = that one

below Wigle's mill, where there is a
very bad spot. +

Mr. Denike thonght it might proper-
used for the Laird avenue or’
St. Arnaud street sidewalks,

The question of whether fit was
cheaper to break up the pavement and
usé it or buy crushed stone was talked
over,

Mr. Denike, that the matter ba left

Carried,

Mr. Denike urged that the question
of a fire alarm system be taken up.
Mr. Baulcli’s: explanation seemed a
feasible one for Amherstburg, It was
costly, but we had to have samething.

Mayor—*“Can't we issue debentures
for this expenditure?”

Mr, ‘Davis, solicitor—"“With the con.
sent of the electors,” Mr. Davis ad-
vised consolidating a number of -out-
standing” expenditures such. as the
deficit on the Sandwich street water
main, dhe cost of repairing the Sand-

stalling a new fire alarm sy®em, and
other odds and ends, and submitting
a bylaw to the people to authorize
the Issue of debentures for the whole
amount. This is what ought to have
been done a few years ago in connée-
tion with the extension of the street
lighting system,

Mr. Turner gave notice of a by-
law to submit the question to the peo-
ple for the’ authorization of these
matters, including. consolidating all
the lfabilities unprovided for exclusive

Mr.

jow about your ' assess-
s a.vitally important mat-
sent time?”
Y interesting discussion of
vening then developed” Mr. Deh.
jad off by declaring that the coun-
cil had been talking for years about

\an ‘agsegament commission as the only

proper way of getting a fair assess-
ment. , He submitted that if M. Bar-
retty Win T. Wilkinson, Colin. Wigle,
L. T. Bray. EdwCrimming and R. C.
Primeau wera appainted- a commis:
sion, that the assegsment of the town
could nor but be acceptable to every-
body, and they were willing to aet.

Mr. Turner jumped on this scheme
with bath feet, quoting the law with
reference to the appointment of an
assessment commission, which’ por-
vides. for the council appointing one
commissioner, he-and the Mayor then
having the power to appoint an as-
Se8s0r Or assessors to make the as.
sesament. There was only one man
in his. mind capable of meking a
proper assessment in Amherstburg.

Moved by Mr. Turner, seconded by
Mr. Laramie, that Thomas W. Crowe
be appointed assessment commission-
ar. h Se ¥
"Phis ralsed quite a storm. Mr. Bert
rand didn't “agree with Mr. Crowe's
appeintment at all. A

Dr. McdBride—“After the job of as-
sessing he did last year, I'd hate-to
appoint him.”

Reeve Brown—"If yon are going to
appoint a Commission ther only way iv
can be done 4s as Mr. Turner said. In
my opinion I think that the assessment
Mr. Crowe left was much better than
it’ is'at the present time.”

Dr. McBride—“It seems funny ~to,
appoint an assessor who never comes
near you when the assessment. {8
made; but. sits in his office and copies
the roll.”

Mayor—*“The appointment of an as-
sessor was left untyl the last minute,
and the assessor bad to copy a good
deal of the former roll.”

counts against Mr. Crowe. He copied
the old rolls and never appeared to
explain his assessment before’ the

DISEASE COMES :

THROUGH THE BLOOD]

To Cure Common Ailments the
Blood Must be Made_Rich
and Red.

Nearly all the common diseases that
afflict ‘mankind are caused by bad,
blood—wenk, watery blood polgbned
by impurities. Bad blood i8-the cause
of headaches and backaches, lumbago
and rheumatism, deblitity and indiges-
tion, neuralgia, sciatica and © other
nerve troubles. It is bad blood that
causes disfiguring skin diseases like ||
eczema, and galt rheum, pimples and
eruptions. The severity or the trouble
indicates how impure the-blood is, and
it goes always from bad to worse, un-|
less steps are promptly taken to enrich
and purify the blood.” There i{s8+no ||
use trying a different medicine for
each disease, for they all come through
the ‘one trouble>-bad blood. To cure
any of thess troubles you must get
right down to the root of the trouble
in the blood. That is just what Dr,
Williams’ Pink Pills do. . They make
new, rich red blood. They simply
purify and enrich the blood, and the
disease disappears. 1at {8 why Dr,
Williams’ Pink Pills have cured thou-
sands of cases after other, medicines |
had failed. Here is proof of the
power of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to
cure, Mrs, M. Stills,» who resides
near the town of Napanee, says: “I
cannot praise Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
too’ highly. I” was ery much run
down in health, suffered from fre-
quent spells, of Indigestion, biliqysness,
and sick headache. L had an almost
constant pain, {i- my “head and my
housework was a source of dread, In
fact 1 felt so mi le that life held
but little enjoyment. I was advised
to try Dr.-Willlams' Pink Pills, which
I did, and thé result was simplysmnar-
yellous, and can jest be summed up
by saying that they made me feel like
a new woman, and fully restored my
health, I would andyise every woman’|
and girl who has poor blood, or i8 run
down in health to give these wonder-
ful pills a trfal. 1 am never without
them in the house."

At the first sign that the blood is
out of order take Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, and note the speedy Amprove-
ment they make appetite, "health
and spirits. You can get these pills
brough any medicine dealer or by mail
ar 50 cents a box boxes for
$2.50 from The Dr. Williamg’ Medicine
Co.. Brockville, Or 2

that the wine was obtained illegally,

We hear a great deal about the Canadian Manufacturer not being able to con-
pete With the American Manufacturer, We are disgusted with the Canadian Manu-

facturer becatise he wants protection. Well, that.doesn’t apply. .tosthe Tile Manufa :-

turers at any rate. We are making tile a whole lot cheaper right now than the tile

makers in Ohio and Indiana in the face of the facts that our fuel costs, us twice to
fh
3 1 :
three fimes as much{ our machinery, repairs, fire brick and practically everything

we use except labor comes from the States, and we are subject to heavy duty and

freight.. Even labor is higher.

Just while we are talking about comparative cost of manufacturing tile, we
want to answer an argument advanced the other day by a farmer who said that clay
hadn't gone up in price, therefore, tile should not go up. Well, for the benefit of those

who might think the same, we will say that the same argument might apply, to
farm produce, and for your entiresatisfaction we will also say that if clay went up -

to $1000.00 an acre, it wouldn't make a difference of more than 50 cents a thou-

sand on 4” tile. In fact we have mever figured that clay cost anything.

How About You, Mr. Farmer ?

"Could you compete with the American Farmer if you had to pay $400.00 to $300.40)

an acre for land? Could you even pay the interest on the mortgage if yon

had. to buy a farm at those figures” “Why not? ' Are you in the same class as the
Canadian Manufacturers? Are you inferior in intellect and enterprize to {io -Ameér-

ican Farmer? or isn’t it simply that you HAVEN'T GOT YOUR FARM TILED?

Do. you appreciate what a wonderful country we have, here? “Do you reat
that in the very near future land is goimg to double and triple in value if itis ;

‘Do yeu, Mr. Township Councillor, you Mr. County Councillor, appreciate the

tremendous responsibility placed on~yomr shoulders? Do, you realize that you are

responsible if the.dand in this District does not rise in value to the equal of the value
