“Protection” For Your Home—
No “Free Trade” With Decay

Everything with a surface needs surface
protection. Not only the .utside of your

. home, but every part of the inside—the
floorsy walls, furniture, woodwork and

To paint, means protection and pre-
servation and money saved on repairs, for.
wear and decay always start atthe surface.

To leave a surface unprotected by paint
or varnish, means “free
