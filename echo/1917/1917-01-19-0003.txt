During the “actumn following his

sider what they should do

“Leave it to chance. Ralph,” he said
“We're ont merely for fun. What dif.

“Don't you ULelieve it,” contradicted |

Bob?”

Ralph. “I've motored around on that
theory and fetched up in all sorts of
Gud forsakeu baics whure they think
New York is as far awar and inacces-

“Let's get along somewhere, any-

A look of dismay overspread the
faces of the two girls.

“We never thought of that!" cried
the fair one.

“Steal!” repeated Dorothy indignant.

loasly. :

“The beauty! Huh! You don't call

Ing glance at bis companion. He went
around to the front of the car

“Your gasoline tank Is cmpty,” "he
announced, ‘and from appearances |
should say that It had been leaking

back down the road in the direction
whence they had come and showed a
black olly streak throngh the center
of the white sand.

“What shall we do~walk back and

asked Dorothy Moore.

ing It. We smuggled it out of the s-
rage and have only come this far, nnd

grouchy!" Dorothy &ighed pathetically.

Bob had been using his ears to good
advantage. “I beg pardon,” he Inter-
rupted, “but Is Jim Wedge Moora your
brother?" ) fo
! “Yes, of course; Do you know him?”
Dorothy's eyes were round with sur-
prise.

“Classmate of ours.” Bob included
Ralph (n a gesture. “My name's Kit-
tredgp. and this is Ralph Dodge.”

“I've heard James speak of you." ad-
mitted Miss Moore a little breathlessly,

“Called me ‘Bonehend Kittredge,”
didn’t he?" asked Bob cheerfully, while
Miss Wakely suppressed a smile.

“Yes, he did—a horrid pame! &d-
mitted Miss Moore, dimpling.

“Not at ally" declared Bob, “You
sec, I was so! clever ‘that the chaps
simply gritted their teeth with rage
and envy and called me ‘Bonehend’ for
spite. It has quite the opposite mean-
ing fn my case." ;

“1 don’t doubt it.” Interpolated Miss
Wakely warmly, and Bob threw her a
melting glance of appreciation. .
“What did they call youn, Mr.
Dodge?” asked Dorothy, looking at
Ralph with Interest. :

“Ob, nothing at all. Miss Moore.” he

sald hastily. “I ‘went through unob-
trusively, leaving not even a footprint
of credit or fame behind. In fact, no
one would ever know I'd been through
college if 1 dldn't advertise the fact.”

“Nonsense!™ chirruped Dorothy,
growing pink In his defense. even as
Miss Wakely had chaomploned Bob's
cADse. .

Then after a discussion it was decid-
ed that Bob and Miss Wakely ‘were to

sion and assistance: ! Feil
