LIBRARY FURNISHINGS.

A Five Piece Set That You Can Make
at Home.

An interesting use of cretonne, bro-
cade or any of the many materiuls
which one encounters in the search for
library fixings is shown in a set of
five articles, all for the IJbrary, and
which, when separated, will not give
that fixed look of having everything
to match,

be square, oblong, round or oyal. The
material, IX cretonne or soft sik, Is
shirred on ‘cords and caught in the
middle under a covered button. A bit
of plain material or'an appliqued fig-
ure from the cretonne or tigured linen
may be substituted for the middle in-
stead of the button,

Next there 18 a ronner for the library.

material. as tho case may be.

with the contrasting materinl and well
made with either buckram or light
pasteboard fodndition to give a real
support to the paper covered book. A
bright cord is substituted for the
usual cord on the telephone book and
passed through cyclets in the cover.

With the telephone goes a screen of
cardboard covered with the selected
material, and lined with the contrast-
ing one. The screen is threefold, and
the middle portion is higher than the
side wings.
