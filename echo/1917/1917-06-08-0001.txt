SATISFACTION
Wherever you find Ford cars and Ford service, you find
SATISFIED FORD OWNERS—men who zpprecinte the car,
for its quick starting, its easy. control; its simplicity and

+

its extraordinary capacity for hard work. :

The phenomenally large sale of Ford cars ip the direct
result of Ford SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION.
Ford satisfaction ig os universal as’ the Ford car itself.
Doctors; lawyers, salesmen,” bakers, grocers and farmers
all praise the Ford—all are satisfied.
Ita low cost appeals to them. Its unusually low upkeep
cost plenses them. Its sturdy, steady, sorvice-glving char
acter wins them and satisfies them. . Even the wealthy
prefer to drive Ford cars rather’than botl cr with the cost-
ly, cumbersome limousine and chauffeur. It means econ.
omy when “soving is a national duty.”

© Ford satisfaction is just as valuable as upholstery, or a °
foncy finfeh, Ask any Ford owner about it. :
