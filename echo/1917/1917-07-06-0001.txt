minfon Day, was a publfe holliday;
and it was generally observed. Naver
before wére so many automobiles seen

morning to night Was constant, and
by mid-afternoon cars were parked in
every available space down town,
while it séemed that the river front
rond for two miles down the bank
couldn't accommodate any more ma-
chines than weresthere. The day was
{deal, and was thoroughly enjoyed by
the visitors. Wednesday. July 4th,
saw another big crowd. It is estim-®
ated that - the ferries carrfed 15,000
excursionists to Bois Blane, while
hundreds motored to Amherstburg and
crossed to the island from here. July
has ushered in perfectly delightful
weather for the holiday season.

—The people of Amherstburg were
‘roused the other evening by what ap-
peared from the whistle to be- a boat
running amuck on Sandwich street,
but it turned out to be only the first
car on the S., W. & A. electric rallway
equipped with air® brakes and “the
regulation whistle making its initial
trip to the 'Burg. The car works to

SATISFACTION |

Wherever you find Ford cars and Ford service, you find
SATISFIED FORD OWNERS—men who eppreciate the car
for its quick starting, its easy control. its simplicity and
its extraordinary capacity for hard! work.

The phenomenally large sale of Ford cars [6 the direct
result of Ford SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION. ;
For satisfattion {8 as - universal as the Ford car itself.
Doctors, lewyers, salesmen, bakers, grocers and farmers
all praise Lhe Ford—all are satisfied. 1

Its low cost appeals to them. «Its y. soricagi upkeep

  

cost plenses them, Its sturdy, steady, service\giving char-
acter wins them and satisfies them. Even {be wealthy -
prefer to drive Ford'cars rather than bot) sr with the cost- \ rt
1y, cumbersome limousine and chauffeur. It means econ- E
omy when “saving {8 a national duty.” :
Ford satisfaction Is: just as valuable as upkLolstery, or a
fancy finiash. Ask any Ford owner about it. H

If youn intend to buy a Ford, place your order with the
nearest dealer. :
