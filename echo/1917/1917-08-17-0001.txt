VOTERS’ LISTS.

More light Is being thrown fn the
new Provincial Voters’ List Act every
day since the municipal lists are be-
| ing issued, and the new Act is any-
| thing but pleasing to the many over-
| worked and very often inndequately
paid township clerks, who looked to
[ the fees from voters’ list court to sup-
plement their salaries Under the
new Act, voters’ list courts will largely
disappear, as the matter of adding
legislative voters—both male and fe-
male, is entirely removed from the
province of municipal officials, and
will be placed in charge of enumer-
ators in each municipality, who in the
nature of things will receive their ap-
pointment as a reward for party ser-
vices, unless the whole system of the
apoils belonging to the victors Is re-
volutionized,

The v-ters’ lst Is mpde up in* two
parts under the néw Act, part one con-
taining the nomes of those who have
votes in both. municipal elections and
elections to the Legislative Assembly,
and part 2, consisting of non-resident
owners, wlio have only a right to vote
at municipal elections. In part 1 is
found the names of those married
women and widows who own thelr
own property or are tenants, and ss
usual’ the number is negligible

The elimination of part 3, which for-
merly contained the names of electors”
only qualified to vote at legislative
elections leaves room for some criti.
clsm, not only on the ground of ont-
ting municipal clerks out of théir Just
fees, but fo secure the names of the
male and female electors entitled to
vote” at legislative clections, a cum-
bersome znd expensive method is em-
ployed. A registration board for each
county consisting of the judges, Crown
Attorney, Sheriff, Registrar and Local
Master, sits in judgment They ap-
point a clerk of their Board, and
enimmerators for each polling suhdi-
vision in the county, whose duty it is
to make a house ta house canvass for

A new measure for the taking: of
soldiers’ votes was introduced at the
opening of the Dominion Parliament
Monday, by Judge Doherty. The
minister stated that since the first bill
conditions had grently altered. Those
qualified 10 vote were five or six times
AS numerous ag when the bill was
originally introduced - and the trans-
portation of bellots has:become more
difficult. “All soldiers, naval service
men ‘of Canadajand persons in the Im-
perinl service, those who were being
enrolled .in Canada, may vote. Minor
soldiers may vote and 80 may nurses
and Indians. The bill provides machfn-
ery for taking the ballot overseas prac-

tically as though an election were be- |7

ing held there. The votes will be
counted overseas by special returning
officers. * Elaborate provisions are to
be made for taking the soldier ‘Vote

4 complete election organization cre-
ated” in England :nd France. To en-
able the men In uniform to become ac-
quainted with the issues and the can-
didates, the bill introduced Monday by
the Minister of Justice provides that
there shall be four weeks between the
nomination and the: polling. This will
considerably lengthen the campaign.
The four weeks’ time applies to the
civilian voting in Canada as well as to
the soldier vote at he front. The new
law is called the “military voters’ act,
1817." The Min|ster of Justice ab.
tained first reading for, it * Monday®
Judge Doherty stated that this law
would supercede that of two years ago,
by which the soldiers were given votes.
