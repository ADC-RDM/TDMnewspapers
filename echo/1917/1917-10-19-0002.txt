—The following interesting query and
reply appeared in the legal columns of
a provincial newspaper Saturday:— |
“S. C. B,, Walkerville—If a wife de-
serts her husband without any just
cause, taking furniture and everything
she chooses with her, can she be
prosecuted for theft? (2) Can she
sue her husband for alimony? (3) Can
he sell the property from her dower? |
Ans.—Formerly a husband could not
be prosecutéd for stealing from his
wife and a wife could not be presecut-
ed for stealing from her husband
while living together; but the Criminal
Code was amended in 1913, so as to |
mike a husband or wife . liable to
prosepution for fraudulently taking or
disposing of goods or property of the
other while intending to desert. (2)
In the present case the woman can be
arrested and prosecuted for theft. (3)
She cannot successfully sue for” ali-
mony after having deserted her hus-
band. (8) The husband can sell his
property subject to his wofe's inchoate
right of dower. Jut under the eir-
gumstances mentioned the judge of
the County Court may make an grder
barring the wife's dower.”

a sugar beet: factory here, the pro-
moter of the enterprise makes it a
requisite on the part of the town to
gecure contracts from growers, who
will produce 8,000 acres of sugar beets.
The factory will be located near the
lake, and cost in the neighborhood of
$800,000, giving employment to 250 to
300 hands the year round. After an
expenditure of $400,000 the town will
probably be asked for a . loan of
$100,000, payable. in ten years at 6
per cent. The lowest price pald for

to, whether the council should under-
take the securing of the required
