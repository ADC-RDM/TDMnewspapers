THE ENERGY FOOD
The Vim Sl Vids One Gets

There is something in oats which creates
opirit and energy. No other grain can bring
results like them. Everyone knows what
oats do for horses. They have the same
effect on man.

An extract of oats is employed asa tonic.
A dict of oats multiplics one's vitality.
That's why energetic men—men of vim
and spirit—are said to “feel their oats.”

In Quaker Oats the finest oats—Canadiar:
grown-are subjected to 62 tings Just
the rich, plump'grains are used. ‘There is
only ten pounds of Quaker Oats in a bushel.

These grains have the maximum 6f rich.
ness and energy. They are also the most
delicious. Fo eat Quaker Oats pnce a d

tonic effects, what bubbling vitality
can get from oatmeal. One never know

 

    

  
 

how good oat food is, or what it can do, un-

CANADIAN NEWS.

Harvesting in the west Is a weok
earlier than last year;. the wheat crop
promises to be uniformly high in qual-
ity, and danger from frost Is about
past.

Mary, seven-year-old * daughter of
Mrs, Minnie Lyon, of Beaverton, was
fatally shot when her young brother
and sister, in the mother's absence,
were having target practice.

All allen enemies in Military Dis-
trict No. 1 (Western Ontario) may be
interned, on General Ofter's recom-
hmendation, on account of violations
of the order In Council respecting
their travel only by permission of the
police.

British subjects enlisted in the Can-
adian Expeditionary Force, whether
they have ever been residents of Can-
ada or not, are to have a vote under
the military voters’ bill, which now
stands for third reading in the Com-
mons.

One of the most heartrending stor-
les arising from the war and striking
Brantford las just been learned of
there. A short time ago a family
learned ‘officially that their som was
returning from the front. Some time
elapsed, however, and no further word
of the sons’ arrival reached there.
The anxious family got into communi-
cation with the Militia Department at
Ottawa, and Were [nformed that they
would find thelr missing hero in the
hospital for the the insane at Hamil
ton!

The "page In the Chicago Public
school speller Which eulogizes Emper-
or William of Gérmany probably will
be in the book when school opens in
September, it having been found im-
possible to prepare a new one in time,
as had been ordered. A movement has
been started to ‘designate an hour at
the, opening day of school for the chil-
dren to tear out the leaf containing
the eulogy, and Anthony Czarnecki,
of the Board of Education, announced
that when the board met he would im-
troduce a resolutipp providing for.the
elimination of the page.

“The obligation is &ll on the other

Turning quickly, I saw n man stand.

I stood looking at him, not knowing
what to suy © him. He was an intel.

was stampid upon his features, but a

It Had Farreaching
Results

  
  

 

By ELINOR MARSH

 

 
 

I am of an artistic temperament.
From my earliest girlhood I had loved
beautiful scenes. I took to drawing
pictures carly and in time became a
water color sketcher. In summer timp
I drove around in a vehicle called a
rockaway, drawn by an old horse that
had been in my family a long while
and in whom I had every confidence,

At night I would sometimes stop at
a hotel, sometimes at a farmhouse, and
occasionally would place my blankets

on grassy ground and spend the night
in blvouac.

BURG ECHO.

“Fairy gpdmother,” 1 sald cloud, “do

One evening when I was some miles
from a town, which I expected to
reach before dark, Bob went lame.
Looking about for shelter—for I could
not get on with a lame horse—I espled
a short distance ahead of me, perched
on a ledge, a cottage. It was as artistie
a plece of architecture as I over saw,
with {ts ‘grounds and vines growing
over it. Indeed, the tout ensemble
constituted a thing of beauty. If 1
could only be permitted to spend the
night there I would be delighted.

I managed to get Bob to the gateway
of the place and up a short winding
road leading to the house. I was dis-
appointed in not seeing any one about,
and as I drew near it occurred to me
that’ the place was unoccupied. Tha
blinds were not closed and there wag
nothing to indicate that the house was
empty. What was it that told me that
the place was desgrted ?

Leaving Bob Standing in the road.

on the front door with a brass knocker

been any one within, that those knocks
would have sounded so hollow. I listen.
ed, but there was no indication of any
one stirring. Going around to the rear
I falled to see any indication of a liv-
ing being. There were no chickens, no
dog, not even a lonely cat. Only a
few flowers In beds near the house that
I judged grew without being cultivated.
There was a woodshed and some wood
in it, but plenty of room for Bob in
case I should have to leave him there.

Looking, in at a window, I saw a
library with a fine broad fireplace and
among the furniture a large lounge.
The sash was locked, and I went to
other windows, but found them locked
also. A trellis led to an upper window.
It looked easy to climb, and I went up
it and found the sash unlocked. I went
Into a bedroom and down a staircase.
The front door was locked and no key,
but 1 opened a side door by turning
the latch.

1 could understand the fascination of
burglary so interested was I in appro-
priating the premises to my use for the
night: There was a zest in temporarily
owning this place, so beautiful and yet
80 desolate, which was enhanced- by
my. having to break into it and learn
what there was sulted“to my necessi-
ties.

The next thing was to unharness
Bob and’ give him his supper. Then I
went into the house with my lunch box,
in which I always kept something and
In which I now fortunately had enough
to satisfy my appetite, There were
cupboards in which'eatables might bo
stored, but they were locked. After
eating 1 lighted a lamp in: the library
and looked over tho books. It was evi-
dent that whoever had filled these
shelves was a well educated and intel
ligent person. 1 have never before
come‘upon a lbrary in which every
book had a value. And what surprised
me most was that gome of the books
were up to date. I read tll quite late,
then, throwing ‘nyself on the lounge,
put out the lamp and went to sleep.

astonished to detect the odor of coffee.

i Tho Tractor has paid us big on our farm. Why will it not pay you far x
mers of Essex County? “Do not talk war, but produce. Maybe you will say,
“I-bave not enough land to buy a tractor.” Don't you know your neighbors
have every year from 25 to 50 acres that is not cultivated? Don't you know 5
these idle acres would laugh with joy to be turned over with a tractor?

When the ground is hot and dry you can always harrow, work and drill your
grain In; you can also harvest, thresh and haul your grain to market, or run
your foed grinder. : -

This Is the best time of the year to buy a tractor. If you are going to
put in more than 6 acres of fall wheat, have a talk with us; for we have the
tractor or horse implements that will do the job O. K.. oT

Give your sons better implements to work with and they will farm more
land with less work. y : ¥
If interseted call 130-21 and we will see you. LL
