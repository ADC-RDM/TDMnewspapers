Only One-Third of the Oats Are Fit

‘To make a really delicious oztmeal, one
must use just tho plump, rich grains. Com-
mon oatmeal, made of oats as they ron,
lacks flavor and richnees, And it lacks,
above all, that wealth of energy element
which'makes one *[ecl his oats.”

Thousands'of people cat oatmeal without
ever knowing what a wimsproducing food
it is. They never know how enticing it can
be. They buy oats in bulk without even a
brandon them to guarantee the grade they
pet.

E The choicest oats are sifted 62 times in
etting the grains ised for Quaker Oats,
nly ten pounds in a bshel —the choicest

thirdiof the finest vats=is good enough for

Quaker, §

The Quaker proccss makes these
into an oat food worth having. One who
once eats it will never again care for a coms
mon oatmeal, a
SOats are the vim-producing food. But
thcy who get tho utmost effects are the
caters of Quaker Oats.

Ing Instruction In agriculture and hor

to grow plant of food vilue in school

the space hitiorto devoted to flowers
and decorative shrubs. With tho same
object in view, the home garden pro-
ects ghoul? be enlarged and modified
and extensive use made of vacant lots
and other unoccupied areas. In this
way adventage might be taken of the
Potential jabor of boys and girls from

in Ontarjo having a population of
from 1,000. to 9,000 would doubie the
present production of their gardens

little one is beyond aid. The wise
mother will always safeguard her 1it-

ways does good=—it can never do
harm, Concerning it Mrs. Napoleon
Lambert, St. Ignace, Que. writes: —
“Baby's Own Tablets are an excel
lent medicine for childhood ailments
and I am well pleased with their

UNITED FARMERS OF ONTARIO

FOR RECIPROCITY,

Reciprocity was uncnimously adopt-
od by the 450 delegates of the United
Farmers of Ontario in convention in
Toronto, last week, accompanied by
the demand that the question be sub-
mitted by the Government to a refer-
endum.

The following clauses of the pro-
posed national farmers’ platform were
unanimously adopted:

1. By reducing tae customs duty on
&oods imported from Great Britain to
one-inlt the rates charged under, the
general tariff and that further general
on
British imports that will insure com.
Plete free trade between Great Britain
and Canada In flve years,

2. That the regiprocity agreement of
1911, which still remnins on the Unit-
ed States statute books, be accepted
by the Parlinment of Canada.

& That all the foodstuffs not in-
cluded iz the reciprocity agreement be
placed on the free.Mst. ’

4: That agricultural Implements,
(a*m machinery, vebicles, fertilizer,
coal, Fsmber, cement, illuminating fuel
and _bricating oils be placed on the
free lls

0. Tht the customs tariff on all the
heceigaries of life, be materially re-
duceq, ¥

6. That all tariff concessions granted
to other countries be (mmedintely ex-
tended {6 Great Britain.

In the afternoon an address was de:
livered by H, W. Wood, -president of
the United Farmers’ of Alberta, In
which be smphasized that in the future
class mobilization for tie purpose: of
8erving the great system of trade and
COmi\grce would be essential.

commendations for direct taxation:

“By a direct tax on unimproved

sources. Va en

“By a sharply graduated’ Income

required for the sald cleaning, enlarging, deepening, extending and other-
% wise improving the said Balley Drain. ‘ )

Provisionally adopted the 6th day of March, 1917.

Whoreas one E. J. Burns, owner of part of Lot Number elglity-two (82)
in the Seventh Concession of this Townshp, has given notice to this Munfiofs
pality that the Bailey Drain is out of repair and does nat provide sufficient
drainage for his portion of sald Lot Number Bighty-two (82) in the Seventh

And whereas thereupon the Council of the Towiship has procured’'n sur-
vey aud fn examination to be made by Charles Ross McColl, being a person
competent for such purpose, of the sald aren proposed to be drained and the
means suggested for the drainage thereof, and of other lands and roads liable
to be assessed under the Municipal Drainage Act, and has also procured
plans, specifications and estimates of the drainage work to be made by the
said Charles Ross McCall and an assessment to be made by him of the lands
and roads to be benefitted By such drainnge work, and of other lands and

will be Jsrived; or Incurred in consequence of such drainage work by every
road"@d lat, of portion of lot, the said assessment so made being the assess.
ment hereinafter by this By-law enacted to be assessed and’ levied upon the
roads and lots or parts of lots hereinafter in that behalf specinlly set forth
and described, and that the report of the sald Charles Ross McCall in respect
thereof, and of the sald drainnge work being as follows:

Windsor, November 28th, 1916.
To the Reeve and Municipal Council of the Township of Maiden: —

Gentlemen,—In nccordance with your fmetructions I have made a survey.
and examination ofsthe Bailey Drain in your Township, and of the southerly
portion of Lot 82, Con. 7, with a view to provide drainage for certain parts
thereof, and beg to report thereon as follows: —

I commenced my survey at stake 0 at the outlot of the drain Into Long
Marsh Drain, and followed its course upstream to ita head at stake 87.80, and
thence surveyed an extension of the drain to stake 92.60 nt the middle of
Lot 82, I found the lower part of the drain badly filled with sediment, ete.,
and the middle and upper portions of the drain also badly filled, and would
recommend that the drain be deepened and improved and extended to stake
92.60 in nccordance with the accompanying plans, profile and specifications.

From stoke 87.30 to stake 92.60 there is already a ditch whose value to
the work I' have estimated at $16.00, which sum fs to be paid to William A.
Bailey, owner of S:3% N'W 3% Lot 82, the owner of the ditch.

I further find that each of the following owners fs entitled to and should
receive the following amounts as compensation for damages to lands and
crops, if any:—

Con. 7 Pt S pt 78
7 WX E% 79.
NE % 80...
S E pt 80...

Pt S E pt 81.7
S W pt 81

N 1% NW 1; 82,
S% NW 82.

I have provided tor these In my estimates. 3

I have also provided for an allowance of $18.00 for a farm bridge tor
Charles A. Bailey, owner of part of lot 86, Con. 7, to be paid to him. J

My estimate of the cost of the whole of the above work together with
all incidental expenses is the sum of $1,017.00. - Of this amount I. have
assessed the lands which ore benefitted by or which use the sald drain as
an outlet with the sum of $977.00, and the Township of Malden for ronds with
the sum of $40.00, as 48 more fully set forth In the schedule of assessments
hereto annexed.

Accompanying this report you will find
and schedule of assessments.

All of ‘which Is respectfully submitted.
