troduced by Senator Robinson, of Ar-
kansas, who declared the print paper
industry trust controlled. “Unless

—A nice question In efficiency and
arithmetic would be to figure out just
how much the town would4 save in
fuel, wear and tear, etc, if every open
closet in Amherstburg were shut off
and the domestic supply of water were
placed on the meter system.

—The cold and backward weather
of this spring has had a bad effect

HEALTHY CHILDREN

It is natural for r little ones to.be well,
and with care every baby can be kept
well. The main thing towards keeping
little ones well is to keep their little
stomach sweet and their bowels regu:
lar. Baby's Own Tablets will do this.
Thousands of mothers keep the Tab-
lets in the house nnd they find them
an efficient guard against illness. Com
cerning them Mrs, Hiloire Desmarais,
St. Joseph de Sorel, Que., writes:—
“1 belleve Baby's Own Tablets are the
best medicine in the world for chil-
dren. My baby was terriby consti:
pated but the Tablets promptly cured
him and now he is a big healthy
child.” | The Tablets are sold by medi
cine dealers or by mail at 26 cents a
box from The Dr. Williams’ Medicine
Co., Brockville, Ont.
