BAR POINT CO, vs.
CHAPPUS AND HEALEY

Interesting Land Case Settled at Sand-
wich.

The trial of the action of the Bar
Point Land Co. and Alfred J. Woods,
of Amherstburg, against Chappus &
Healey, brought to recover possession
of a portion of the marsh adjoining
Big Creek in the Township of Malden,
which the defendants claimed to have
bought from the plaintiffs, was com-
menced on Monday before Mr. Justice
Clute at Sandwich, and continded until
noon.on Tuesday, when the Judge in-
timated to the parties that he believed
an agreement had béen made for the
anle of the portion of the property in
dispute to the defendants, but that ap-
parently there had been some mis.
understanding as to the line, and he
advised them to get together with a
view to a settlement,

Befare court reopened, the parties
came 40 an agreement whereby the
plaintifia undertook to convey to the
defendants that portion of .the marsh
lying north and east of the lands con-
tracted torbe sold by the plaintiffs®to
the Chatauqua Association, contain:
ing about 125 acres, each party to pay
their own costs

This gives the defendants both sides
of the creek where their fishery has
been located, and approximately half
of the marsh lands
Bride Bros. to the Bar Point Company,
the plaintiff and the Chatauqua ASBO-
clatfon retaining the remainder.

The Quarterly Bonrd of the Malden
Methodist church met at the Zion ap-
pointment to conduct the business of
the fourth quarterly meeting. The
business proved the state of the cir
cult to be in a very good condition,
the salary paid tlds year being greater
than in any other yesr in the history
of the church. H. Hedges moved, sec-
onded by J. R. Balkwill, that the Quar-
terly Board petition the Conference to
consider the circuit as ® special case,
and to permit the pastor, Rev. S. J, T.
Fortner, to remain ‘for the fifth year.
Before the motion was put, the pastor
addressed the meeting, expressing his
great appreciation for the kindness
and co-operation of the Hoard and peo-
ple during his term of four years’ pas-
torte, and thought it best to consider
the usual time limit of four years suf-
ficient, and to chsnge his field of labor.

A petition was presented to the
council-at Its regular meeting, Mon-
day, by residents of the river front,
askihg that the front road be closed
and a new road be opened somewhere
farther back. The matter was held in
abeyance. In the meantime, those op-
posed to the change have got busy,
and are circulating a counter petition,
and the matter is likely to be fought
to a finish." There is jus: a question

HE QUESTION I5-

as to whether, objection having devel-
oped, the front road can be closed,
the argument being advanced that it
would be contrary to the public inter
est not only in Malden bu} to out
slide municipalities. On the other
hand,” it has been suggested that a
rear road -¢an be opened, If the need
can be shown, and this could be used
for all traffic and farm purposes,
while the front road would be retiin-
ed as a boulevard drive. Now the
question is before the public no
dougt many arguments on both sides
will be advanced.
