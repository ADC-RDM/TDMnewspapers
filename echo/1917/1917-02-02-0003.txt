Peps are little tablets coutaining

when placed upon the tongue, immedi-
ately turn into vapour, nud are at once
breathed down the air passages to the
lungs. On their journey, they soothe
the inflamed and Irritated membranes
of the bronchial tubes, the deliente walls
of the air passages, and finally enter
and carry relief and healing to the Jungs

In a word, while no liquid or sol
can get to the lungs and air passages,
those Peps fumes get there direct, and
at once commence their work of healing,

CUTED

 

As Result of a Dare.

Recklessness, for which he was not-

ed by other members of his battalion,

while on active service in France, re-
sulted in the death, Thursday evening;
of St. Clair. Walker; a returned sol-
dier, who was electrocuted in the

Thompson Auto Co. garage, 99 Pitt

street west, Windsor, as the result
| of a “dare.” ::

Walker, with Herman « Konopaska
and Thomas Bulmer, fellow-employ-
ees, were golng off duty at 6 o'clock
and went to the rear of the garage to
turn off the electric current charging
storage batteries,

Jokingly, he discussed the effect of
220 volts, the strength of the current,
on a man, and sald he.dld not think
that mueh “juice” would hart him.
Although advised against meddling
with the'eharging apparatus, he grasp-
ed. the charging appartus with each
hand. WW L

There was a blinding flash a% the
fuse was burned out and Walker sag-
ged to the floor unconscious. Dr. J¢

Artificial. respiration was resorted
to but it was of no avail. The body
was removed to Tuson's undertaking
rooms, There was no: inquest. The
remains were sent to Florence for in-
terment.

Womanhood Approaches,

Girls upon the threshold of woman-
liood often drift into a decline in spite
of all caro and attention. How often
one sees girls who have been strong
and llvely become suddenly weak, de-
pressed, Irritable, and listless. It Is
the dawn of womanhood—a crisis in
the life of every girl—and ° prompt
measures should be taken to keep the
blood pure and rich with the red tint
of health, If the blood Is not henlthy
at this critical stage the body Is weak-
med and grave disorders follow. Dr,
Villiams' Pink Pills have saved thous-
mds of young girls from what might
Jaye heen lifelong invalidism or an
carly death. They are a blood-builder
of unequalled richness, strengthening
weak nerves and producing a liberal
supply of red, healthy blood which ev-
ory girl needs to sustain her strength.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills have proved
their great value over and over again
to young women whose health was
failing. Miss A. Sternburg., Haliley-
bury Road, New Liskeard, Ont., says:
“I have much reason to be grateful to
Dr. Willlams' Pink Pills as they re-
gtorod me to health, if
did not save my life. In 1914 | began
to feel run down, and the doctor who
wag oallod in sald that mine was
bad case of anaemia. 1 lost flesh, al-
ways felt tired, and I got so nervous
that 1 could scarcely hold a cup to
take a drink. My heart would flutter
alarmingly. The doctor did not seem
to be able to help me ‘at all and my
family and friends all thought that I
wis in a decline aud could not recov-
ers I ws In bed for some weeks when
an aunt came to see me and urged
that 1 try Dr. Willlams' Pink Pills.
My father got a supply, and ‘by the
time I: had taken three boxes there
was a noticeable Improvement, and
from that on I steadily progressed to-
ward recovery, I contitued using

the pills for some time longer, and
they restored me to my old time
health and “strength. 1 shall never

cease to pralge 4his medicine and to
urge all wenk run down girls to give
it a fair trial as ¥ have proved in my
own case thelr great merit.”

Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are sold by
all dealers in medicine, or you can get

FISH THAT BUILDS A NEST.

 

Remarkable Little Creature That Dis

plays Great Ingenuity In Constructing
Its Children — Eats
Neighbors! Babies—A Cornfield Lady,

a Home For

Tonight, snid Uncle Ben, I am golng

to tell you about

FATHER STICKLEBACK.

 

“What do you think of a fish that
builds a nest?'sasked Uncle Ben.

“A pest down in the water?’ echoed
tittle Ned and Polly Ann.

“Yes,” replied Ben, “a nest that looks
very much like the nests the birds
build in the treetops.

“The fish {8 pamed the stickleback.
The father fish bullds the nest and
takes care of the little ones,

“The fish do not live in the nest, but
the wife Jays the eggs from which the
young fish hatch Inside of ft.

“Tha nest has two doors, and they
open In such directions that the ocean
current passes through them instead
of beating against the frail walls of
the nest and battering them down, as
it might do In time.

“The gum with which the fish glues
together the parts of the nest Is spun
out of fits body, just as the spider
spins out the silk for its web,

“Mrs. Stickleback is n great gadder.
After she leaves the eggs in the nest
she goes swimming off and never both-
ers about the little fishes.

“Father Stickleback, who has built
the nest, watches over it till the little
ones come out of the eggs. Then he
guards them until they are old enough
to take care of themselves.

“It must be a fine thing to see him
swimming abont with his little ones
flocking about. him. If any strange
fish tries to bother them Father Stickle-
back flies at him in a fine rage, and ft
Is apt to go hard with the one who
makes the trouble, for sticklcbacks are
fine fighters. They have a row of sharp
spines on thelr backs, and with these
they can rip and tear their enemies
severely.

“Adthough so kind to their own young
anes, the sticklebacks are not so good
to the young of other fishes. Indeed,
It Is sald that it is thelr weakness for
making a meal of thelr neighbors' ba-
bles that has made them so disliked
by the other dwellers in the water,

“There Is ohe-family of sticklebacks .
that live In the ocean, and they make
thelr nests of seaweeds gummed to-
gether with a sticky thread which the
fish supplies.

"There are other sticklebacks that
live.in fresh water, and their nests are
made of small sticks and twigs which
they can gather togetlor on the river
bottom and are glued together by
means of the sticky liquid which’ the
fish provides,

“The openings in the nest are always
turned the same way that the water
runs, so that it may sweep through in.
stead of aguinst the sides of the nest.”
