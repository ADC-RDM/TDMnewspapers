Ottawa, June 7th.—Following 18 cor-
respondence exchanged between Sir
Wilfrid Laurier and Sir Robert Bor-
den yesterday and to-day anent the
proposal for-a coalition Government:

Sir Wilfrid's Letter.
Ottawa, June 6th, 1917,

Dear Sir Robert: On the 12th of
May you nsked me to meet you on
the following day, which I did. After
explaining fully the condition of the
war in the light of knowledge ac-
quired during your recent visit to
Great Britain you stated the reasons
which had led you to the conclusion
that compulsory service was neces-
sary, and you explained to me the pro-
visions of the Military Service Bill.

You then proposed the formation of
A coalition Government upon the basis
that, outside of the Prime Minister,
each of the two political parties should
have an equal representation in the
Cabinet, and you emphasized the im-
portance of avoiding, if possible, an
election during the war,

I told you at once that If my co-
operation was desired, I regretted that
I had not been invited before you had
announced a policy of compulsory ser-
vice, as | dreaded very serious diffi
culties {f a conscription law was pnss-
ed by the present Parliament, You
réjoined that you had thought {t pre.
ferable to Invite me after the policy
had been enunciated rather than be-
fore.

At an interview which took place
on Tuesday, the 29th of May, "vou sug-
gested to me that you thought it
necessary to “hold a caucus of ‘your
supporters, but desired to consult me
before doing so. I suggested to you
that to hold a caucus of your support-
ers pending megotiations would not
Hkely tend towards tho objects to be
attained. At the sume time 1 sug-
gested that as 1 wanted to’ consult
particularly Sir Lomer Gouin and some
other friends I wéld, like to have a
‘lear statement in*writing of your pro-
posal, which you formulated as fol
lows :—

That a coalition Government should
be formed;

That the military service bill should
be passed;

That a
to enforce fit
election;

That Parliament should be dissolved
and the coalition Government should
seek a mandate from the people,

At the conference on Friday, the 1st
of June, and again on “Monday, the
ith, the possible personnel of a coall-
tion Government was considered.
Some not insuperable difficulties in
that, personnel were anticipated,” and
the subject was not. ¢oncluded. * On
Wednesday, the 6th of June, the final
conference took place at which I an-
nounced that 1 had not seen my way
clear to join the Government on. the
terms “proposed. I asked yéu at the
same'time If conscription was the only
basis, to which you replied in theaf-
firmative. +

At this and previous interviews. I
always stated to you that whenever
conscription was adopted, after a
consultation of the people, 1 would
certainly urge in every possible way
obedience to the law.

Bellevé, me, very sincerely yours,

(Signed) Wilfrid Laurier.

Sir Robert's Reply.

On June 7th Sir-'Robert Borden re-
plied as follows: ~

Dear Shp Wilfrid Laurier: I beg
to acknowledge your letter of yester-
‘day in which you set forth the sub-
stance of recent negotiations respect.
ing the formation of a coalition Gov-
ernment. At our first interview you
had expressed the opinion that. com-
pulsory © service should smot "be en.
forced until it hid been approved by
a referendum or at a general election.
It was for this reason that 1 submitted
the further proposal on the 29th of
May, which is described in the fourth
paragraph of your letter.

I agree that it wag. the policy of
compulsary service which, fn, your
judgment, made it impossible for you
to join a coalition Government, 1
was convinced that compulsory ser-
vice ‘was necessary, and must’ be Ip-

 

pledge should’ be given not
until after a general

 

 

 

 

cluded In the policy of the proposed
i

coalition. You, on the other hand,
decided that you could not
such a polley. and that you cbuld not
Join "a Government which adopted it.
Yours faithfully,

R. L. Borden,

COUNTY COURT

  
 

 

Acting on the ‘suggestion from the
Attorney-General's Départment, ’ Sher-
if” Anderson has notified Tagmbers of
the jury “panel, summoned” for the
next session of the'County Court, that
they need not appear. «&

Registered letters notifying them
to this effect have been sent out, The
matter yas put up to the lawyers and
it was by consent that the ¢ases enter-
ed for Jury hearing at the coming ses-
sion were either set down as non-jury
actions or postponed until the fall

It, waa decided by the Attorney-
General's Department that, owing to

the iden of taking-advantage of sum-|(he grent burden of food production

placed upon the formers, coupled with
the shortage of Tabor, that «dt would
require all the attention of the farmers
on the land this summer. The lawyers
agreed to cid the increased production
campaign by dispensing with the
Juries. .
In, Egsex.. county, this was-easily
done, ns there are no criminal cases
set*down for Judge Cromgole toghear
that would require a jury. The crim-
Inal division of the Connty Court is
now In session and while several
cases of a serjous nature are down
for trial, none of the defendants have
elected for n jury trial. Should any

** tem. In England the order is. a war |do so, it is imperative that a jury be

given, as the wishes of everyone ac-
cused¥must be followed.

The civil list on the County: Court
docket was started Tuesday by Judge
Dromgole.

Thomas. Howe, aged 35, of Mercer
street,” was acquitted when he ap-
peared before Judge Dromgole charg-
ed with a serious offense against his
12-year-old daughter, The girl fafled

JJto tell the same atory as she did in

‘police cpurt at the preliminary hear-
dng and as there was no corrobora-
tive evidence, the court discharged
Howe. W

Molan Spratt, aged 18,

lous offense against a neighbor's

Vednesdny morning of Inst week
Wingtley lost one of its oldest resi-
dents in the persan of Charles Mills,
sr., whe, after only a couple of days
lines, passed away in his 86th year.
Decmsed was born in England on
Febmary 28th, 1832, and came to Can-
ada as a youth of fifteen. He first
settled at St. Paul's, in the township
of Dawnie, Perth county, and for sev:
eral years was in the employ of the
late T. M. Daly, when Stratford was a
mere hamlet. Later he moved to Car-
lingford, Fullerton township, in the
game county, and in April, 1879, mov-
Led: with his family to Wheatley, then
a hamlet of but a few houses, with
almost unbroken forest on three sides.
In the years following, He and his
gons had much to do with the clearing
of the present site of Wheatley, and
witnessed the transition from the vir
gin forest to the beautiful village it
now Is. Many interesting tales were
told by him of the hardships and pri-
vations of the early settlers. Twelve
years ago he lost his wife, and since
that time had been making his home
with the different members of the
family.” He is survived by four sons
and four daughters—Charles, W. H,,
and John, of Wheatley, and A.B, of
Ft. Pelly, Sask.;. Mrs. Charles Brown
and Mrs. A. M. Wilson, Wheatley;
Mrs. A. B. Lounsbury, Assiniboia,

Mrs. P. D. Martin entertained ithe

last, in honor of one of its members,
Master Burton Donnelly, who leaves
this circuit the end of the month. In
the course of their play they were all
gathered in a ring, when the Supt. of
the Dept., Miss May Spinks, present-
ed each little tot with a membership
pin, then Arnold Colenutt, on behalf
of the Dept., presented Burton with a
child's set of 1847 silverware, which
Burton very nicely thanked them all
for, and Mr. Donnelly then spoke to
the little tots for a few minutes, after
which a’/light lunch was served. The
elder people all voted they enjoyed the
time as much as the little tots. All
feel very much indebted to Miss
Spinks for her faithful work.—Mrs, C.

less, tired and discouraged. The rea-
son for this is that the blood has
Been impoverished by the ravage of
the disease through which the victim
has passed. Strength will not return
until - the blood has been enriched.
The blood con be purified and en-
Lriched by no other medicine as quick-
ly and as surely as by Dr. Williams’
Pink Pjlls—to enrich the blood and
strengthen the nerves is the whole
mission of these pills. Thousands

ingsstrength and energy after disease

says:—'After an attack of la grippe 1
was so run down and anaemic that T
could scarcely walk. T had no color,
no appetite and constant headaches.
The medicine I was taking was doing
me no good and I had almost lost
hope of getting better. I was asked to

they were helping me, and after tak-
ing them for a couple of months I
was completely cured. [ now never

one needing a blood builder.”
