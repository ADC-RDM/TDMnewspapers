The Woodmen of the World will un-
veil a monument on-Sunday next at
Rose Hill cemetery, to the memory of
the late Orville Jackson, son of John
B. Jackson, Malden, wlio died on 7th
October last. The ceremony will be
conducted by Clare Jarvis, of Londop,
assisted by members from the vari-
ous camps In Essex county.

During the storm Saturday after-
noon Mghtning struck a tree under
which Wm. Menzies, Leslie Shepley
and his nephew Harold were stand-
ing on the Menzies property. It gave
both Mr. Shepley and his nephew a
very severe shock, In fact for some
time it looked as if Mr. Shepley had
been killed. Upon examination, Mr.
Menzies found life and immediately
worked over him, bringing him to
within an hour sufficient: to walk to
his car with assistance, and he was
taken to his home, where he laid un-
ti] Sunday morning without, regaining
full consciousness. He fs recovering
though still very weak. ' Harold was
knocked down and stunned, but was
revived in a short time. That Mr.
Menzies escaped uninjured is explain-
ed by the fact, that he was wearing
rubber boots. = It was ix very close
call for all of them.

Looking back over the past three
years of dreadful slaughter, we might
stop and nsk ourselves if such awful
happenings are nearly ended, or are we
just at the beginning of this terrible
maelstrom of death. Tt is really dread:
ful to. contemplate, when we think of,
how many promising young mem, who
were just starting on their life's work
nave given up thelr lives to the God of
War—enough you would think to sat-,
{sfy that frightful beast, but this awful
slaughter still keeps up, assuming
larger proportions as time gops slowly
by. Is It the end of all things? Or
will the world come out of this crucible J
a4 more chastened world, a place
where men will be each other's equal?
Alns we know not! Time, which is the
leveller of all grief, will alone tell. We
will have to wait until that time, let
the cost be what It may.

The Boatd of Trustees for the Mc-
Gregor Separate school met on Satur-
doy last and passed,a by-18W providing
for the issue of debentures to the am-
ount of $1,000, to supplement the $5.
000 first raised, to complete the build-"
ing of the school house in the united
sections. When this work was first
projected, the Board thought that $5.
000" would -be sufficient, but owing to
the advance in the price of building
material and*labor, it was found that
when the contract was let it had $1.
000 too little money for the purpose..
The by-law is published for the first
time in this issue of The Echo, and as
soon as the publications are complet
ed, debentures will be issuedi:so’ as to
take care of .the-bill already Contract-
