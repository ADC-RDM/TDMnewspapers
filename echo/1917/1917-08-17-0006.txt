Mr, Crimmins said the Finance Com-
mittee had called up Mr. Pulford and
he agreed to meet them on a certain
night, but failed to show up. Some ar-
rangement should be made to have a
settlement with Mr. Pulford.

Mr. Turner reported that o repre-
sentative of the S, W. & A. Rallway
was down looking over the poles on
Sandwich street. If the town were
agreeable, the Company would putin
new poles where they could not hook
up to the Electric Light Co.'s poles,
and would move them ell over near
the curb, placing them fn a straight
row, which would improve the appear-
ance of the street. By the two ¢om-
panies arranging to use the same
poles where possible, it would do away
with an extra row of poles

Moved by Mr. Brown, seconded by
Mr. Dentke, that he matter be left fa
the hands of the Board of Works.—
