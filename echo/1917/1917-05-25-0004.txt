TWELVE PATROL BOATS

 

Twelve patrol boats are now on duty
between Lake Erie and Lake Huron.
it 18 well to understand that these
boats are for business purposes; that
they are armed, very fast, and are
clothed with abundant authority.

The regulations are thus announced:

Yachtsmen and others operating mo-
tor, boats, sailboats or rowboats are
requested to co-operate with the patrol
that has been established and to obey
the following regulations it has been
necessary to issue:

Disobeying an order from a patrol
officer or not heeding the patrol regu-
lations may make It necessary to use
force. It is expected that all loyal
citizens of the United States and Can-
ada will not make such a step neces-
sary, but realize that the patrol, to be
efficient, must necessarily more or
less inconvenience yachtsmen and oth-
ers operating small vessels:

Patrol vessels will display the Un:
fon Jack and national pennant in the
daytime; at might they will display a
vertical holst of three lights—white,

red and w hite—in the order named.

THE ONTARIO FRANCHISE ACT.

 

 

There +18 no question which should
come closer to the people than the
exercise of the franchise or the condi-
tions under which it may be exercised,
therefore a briet explanation of the
new Franchise Act passed by the Pro-
vincial Parliament
not be amiss. Of course, as publsh-
ed before in these columns, the mat-
ter of extending the vote to women
on the same terms as to men. is of
outstanding importance. Then stu-
dents, nurses and soldiers also are
allowed to vote on elections for mem-
bers of both Parliaments:

ODDFELLOWS BIG TURNOUT

 

A big night In Oddfellowship yas
participated in by Essex ¢ounty. Odd
fellows in the town hall, Amherstburg
on Thursday last, when members of
the order numbering 480, assembled
from all parts of*the county to witness
the exemplification of the first, second
and three degrees, As early as noon
on Thursday Oddfellows begen to
gather, which was an indication of a
big turnout, and by. $30 p.m. every
Oddfellows’ lodge in “Essex county
was represented, some lodge sending
Ja real liv representation. Next to
the lodges which put on the, degrees
| Enterprise Lodge, of Essex, Bent the
largest delegation, there being over 50
Essex members present, while Harrow
sent a delegation of over 40 The
| Leamington members, a§ well as Es-
‘sex and Harrow, made the trip by auto,
and the parking restrictions for the
vicinity of the town hall were brok-
en, as-the 50 autos presented such a
sight as one witnesses on thé ca ampug

had each a special car whose carryl
capacity, was taxed. Eccles J. Gott,
Noble Grand of Rose Lodge, calléd
the brothers to order at 8.30 and after
extending the visitors a hearty wel
come, with the hope thot thelr visit
would be ‘pleasant, profitable and edn-
cative, turned the lodge over to the
Walkerville degree staff, which very
creditably exemplified the. first de-
gree. The members were in a very
receptive mood, and asthe floor work
of the second degree was under way

of ‘Garnet Bdwards, was the recipient
of rounds ‘of applause, The Leaming-

ton team, who seldom visits Amherst.
burg, was then called upon for the
exemplification of the third degree,
and they responded in a masterly

manner, with work the equal of which
lins never been. surpassed in Amherst-
burg. The Leamington team _hns
won favor with the local Oddfellows,
who look forward with very pleasant
anticipation to their next visit .to the
Burg. A large class of candidates, 24
lnsnumber, were Instructed. The
clock work system that was involved
enabled the completion of the three
degrees by 12.45 a.m and instead of
being an all night session, as some
had anticipated, the happy gathering
had dispersed by 1.45 am. The hall
was very prettily decorated for the oc-
casion with flags and "bunting, the
stars and stripes being very conspicu-
ous. The task of feeding mearly 500
hungry men wes no small undertak-
ing, but the system of. supplying their
wants was 80 thorough. that - thirty
minutes only was used by the commit-
tee in serving a sumptuous repast,
of which there was plenty. It was ox-
pected and anounced that the Grand
Master would ‘be present, but at the
last moment t wag found impossible
for him to attend. t Grand Master
R. R. Brett, of Essex; Grand Ropre-
|| sontative James Thompson, of Wind:
| sor, and District Deputy Grand Mas-
ter Enos McCausland, of Essex, were
amopg those present. A short after
qunch program was arranged, but ow-
ing to the lateness of the hour and the
enger desire of the members to get
started on their ‘long trip homeward,
it was dispensed with. This was the

_ MALDEN RI'ER FRONT ROAD,
(The Editor of Mo Echo:i— ]

 

80 active in thecirqulation of petitions
to close this beautiful river view
drive, whiat should never be permit-
ted.

In the rst place our petitioners are
not asking for any huge sum of money
to be spem on the road, which would

be required In case a new road were

built. The stone which the township

put in tg protect the bank gave good | °

resultszand our petitioners have con-
fidence tha: the council wil look after
our present needs. Only a very small
portion of the road needs attention, 80
far as breakwater is concerned. It is
{n better shape now than for a number

of years.
Moreover, a majority of owners on

the front desire that the road be left
where it {s, while the ratepayers far-
ther down who are interested by rea.
son of using this road are practically
unanimous in their wish to have a
front road, while the general public,
who have something to say about ft,
is not willing to give up this beaut
ful drive.

On the other hand, to close the
front rond would not be doing justice
to those who have invested in prop-
erty at Bar Point and Erie Beach,
whose activity there drew the atten-
tion of others to the desirability of
Malden front, and they are against the

proposed change “to'a man.”
The whole movement has the flavor

of a big real estate game, which Is
being put under way at the expense
of the township, The general public
is led to belleve that the proposed new
road will be given and fenced free of
cost, which is not the case,

Our petitioners claim an attempt is
being made to do them an injustice
and are not willing to give or even
soll a road allowance through their
farms, which would be a great incon-
venience and detriment to their farms
and the community in general. Leave
the road where it is,

Yours truly,
B. A. PATTON.
