Besides growing many vegetables
for Immediate Wee the backyard
garden should produce sgme veget-
ables which can be stored for. con-
sumption during Winter months.
Some, of course, \O not need to be
planted as carly #b the plants which
were: described (ist: week. Possibly
a week should elapse from thé time
the ‘lettuce ig planted before these

should be sown.

BEETS, CARROTS, PARSNIPS,
AND SALSIFY, These include the
most fmportant jnembers of ‘the root
vegetables, They are usually grown
for winter purposes, though beets
and carrots are relished by many in
their earlier Stages of growth: All
these demand practically the same
attention. The seeds should be sown
in straight rows at a depth of about
three-quarters ©f an fnch, When the
plants have refiched a height of two
inches they showld be carefully thin-
ned out so that they stand, beets
and parsnips thirec to four inches
apart, carrots and salsify two or
three inches apart, It will be found
that the parsni aro very slow Erow-
ers, and for this reason it is spome-
times advisable 10 plant a few sceds
of lettuce with the parsnip seeds su
that they will setve as a marker. Th
young: beet plants may bo used as
spring greens. It is neccessary that
the. soll be culitiviited at Intervuir
during. the sunumer months so thal
the crops may &row.. They do nol as
a geperal rulle require as heavy
tering as some of the other vegetanle
crops. + In the fall the beets should
be pulled up and the tops twisted off
close to the lbead, nat cut off with a
knife as in tlhe case of ‘carrots, pare-
nips, or saluilfy, which should have
the tops cut atbout one-half inch from
the roots preparatory. to storing for
winter use.

CORN. In planting corn holes
about tww or three inches deep
should be made with a boe.. Five or
six kernells of corn should be drop-
ped. in thils and covered with soll,
which should be gently firmed by
tramping on it. When the shoots
are about three (nches high all ox-
ceptimg the three sturdiest should be
pullisd out. The soil should be
drawn up around the stalks as they
grow, ito give tiem support. When
the. kernels on the cob appear full of
mill they aro ready to use, It in
alo a good practice to cultivate the
sof] often’ around the corm, for ex:
pert growers claim that - the crops
corn and cabbage faster and better
when plenty of cultivation is given.

A Sketch of Juvenile
Love

it

By F. A. MITCHEL
BR a a a hs amd tas aaa dd

Spring is the season of flowers add
love, ns has been remirked before, it
seems, to the present writer. He does
not claim originality: for tbe remark.
But it is us true now as it was when
first made, some centuries ago, and all
English and American poets from
Chaucer to the present poet laureate
have enlarged on the theme.

Why not use it, therefore, to intro-
duce a little tale, or sketch, rather, of
a very young man and a very young
maid and lowers and ‘flour?

3llly Atherton was neariog sixteen—
that is, be was at an age when two
things monopolized the limited space
there was in bis undeveloped brain,
the first being his clothes, the second
a girl. It may seem absurd to put
the clothes before the girl, but such is
the proper relation. There ore a great
many girls, but only one wardrobe, for
a young man, and be requires ‘ that
Avardrobe to be exactly In vogue.

The first sign Billy showed of ap-
proaching manhood was, when he was
fourteen. Then he- displayed marked
concern about Nis neckwear. Later
a new complication developed: then
the period for long trousers came on.
The color of lis neckwear must match
the color of his socks. Nothing would
induce him to wear socks that were
not clocked. His favorite shade for
bis scarf and socks was a brilliant
yellow. and. woe betide the tailor who
produced a pair of tronsers for him
that were not short enough to display
seven-elghths of his hosiery:

When Billy was Invited to his first
formal dance he was confronted with
the most important question thus far
of bis life. , Should hp Wear a swallow-
tall or a tuxedo? - If a tuxedo, shonld
he wear a white of black vest, a white
or black tie? In Billy's time boys of
his age were supposed fo pass upward
and, onward to full dress through a
tuxedo. So, notwithstanding that he
wag invited to a formal dance, he myst
wear a tuxedo. i 553

Consultation with half a dozen other
boys of bis age soon cleared the way
through the vest. and tle problems.
They were to be both black. But Billy
struck o snag on the collar: There was
unfortunately a division of opinion.
Some of the boys ruled for a standing
some for a turndown ‘colla¥. During
the afternoon before the dance. Blly
‘was in a feyer of suspel whether it
should\be standing or tarndown. Final.
ly the matter was settled by a tele
phone message from his [haberdasher,
who, after consulting a periodical giv-
trig such fashions, assured Billy that if
he wore anything except turndows
collar the bottom w ide drop out of
the universe. That d-the final
momentous question as to how Billy
should be arrayed on going to bis first
formal dance. ¥

Since Billy was to enter upon his
first love affair during tho evening of
this dance one would suppose that the
apparel of the girl he was to, fall in
love. with should be also. described.
Betty Hinsdale. aged: fourteen. and
ten months, was as much converncd
about her party get up aki was Billy
about fils apparel. A dress had been
especinlly prepared for the occasion.
But if ber costume were i ba dn mi-
ni ‘described as Billy's, iss been it
no fuqulre 13 oon to do the job.

with water and, returning to his win.

the flower planter.- There wns just
enough of a sprinkling to cause her to
fear u donche. She arose from ber
work and marched into the bouse. On
her way she cast a glance up at Billy
and made a “face” at him. Billy in
return threw her a kiss from the tips
of his fingers.

This time Billy saw enough of the
girl to be sure that she was pretty.
What olse she was Le did not know
and did not care to know. He had at-
tracted her attention, though he bud
been obliged to sprinklo her to do do.
She had brought the sprinkling on
herself by giving him a. stage SnOw-
storm, and as for the face sie had
made at bim he did not mind that a
bit.

The next day wien: Billy was golug
up the steps, getting out his 1atchkey,
who should come out of the front door
of. the next house but the girl. She
passed him with her nose in the air,
ut she bad scarcely reached the sides
walk when Billy beard a giggle. He
turned and tried to get up his courage
to follow and joln ber, but be had not
been introduced to her; and should she
scorn him he would never recover from
the blow. She had floured him and he
hind flowered her, but this did not.con-
stitute an introduction. He would no
more dare speak to her without the
formal introduction required in social
\ife than he would return to his knicks
erbockers.

Such'wiis the condition between these
two next door neighbors when Billy
was Invited to his first formal dance.
He began to array himself at 6 o'clock }
for a function that was supposed to f
begin at balf past & Much time was
required. He put three sets of studs
in his shirt ‘before be was entisfied
with a set of tiny mosaics. He had
Inserted gold links In bls cuffs, and
this necessitated a further change, for
had he worn mosale studs with gold
gloeve buttons’ he would expect to be
ordered out of: the house by the host.
The tying of his neckwear was anoth-
er delny requiring: some twenty-five
minutes. He succeedéd in placing It
above the collar button, but was in
terror lest it slip down.

He was informed by his mother, who
stood by him nobly in this critical
period of his life, that be would surely
be late, and at last he put the Guishing
touches to his~ makeup and. going
downstairs and out, entered a limou-
sine that had been summoned to trans-
part him to the scene of hoped for con-
quests. As he was driving away a
car stopped next door. He wondered
it the girl who lived there was going
anywhere. g

Billy on reaching his destination
spent half an hour in the dressing
room. Whether At was for further
arrangement of his appare] or 8 stage
(right at appearing at his first function
there Is no record. Neyertheless be
held on to the banister on his way
