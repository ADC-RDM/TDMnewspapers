ChristmasEve Carol [nessun rur.:-. -

= 4
Y Lord was bormrin Bethlehem
Upon the Christmas eve.
Ah, slack of heart and slow of heart,
Who will not him receive!

My Lord was born in Bethlehem,
And waiting shepherds heard
Sweet angel heralds chanting lond

The long awaited word.

My Lord was born in Bethlehem,
And in a manger laid.
None tended him, nome cherished
him,
Save that sweft mother-maid.

My Lord was born in Bethlehem,
And wise men came to see

His lowly state and homage paid
To his mild. majesty.

My Lord was born in Bethlzshem,
But soon he had to flee,

For cruel hate of sinful man
Spared not his infancy.

My Lord was born in Bethlehem,
But home had none on earth;
A pilgrim and a stranger he,

An exile from his birth.

My Lord was born in Bethlehem.
He died, but rose again.
Rich js the gift his death hath
bought—
New life for sinful men.
—ZEthelbert D. Warfield in Inde-
pendent. |

{ TheChristmasTree’s Uses:

. The balsam fOr is almost known
botanically as the “Christmas tree,”
for when the carefully recording scl-
entist states that the balsam fir grows
to a height of (fty or sixty fcet, that
its wood is used for the manufacture
of boxes, that its bark furnishes the
balsam used in medicine and art, that
its leaves are gathered for fragrumt

ancient Teutons used to celebrate the
winter season by decking a little fir
treo In bits of tinsel, flowers, toys, or
naments of various kinds, for to them
it wns a symbol of the glorious sun:
which they worshiped. The symmet-
rical spreading and raying . of. the
branches of the Or reminded them of

“The Actors’ Christmas

Tho troupe had been playing In hard
luck. . Fifty dolla now and then-
$100, were tho nightly ‘receipts, hardly
enough to pay the railroad “jumps,”
let alone pay salaries. There was Just
enough money in the treasury to get
to Wayville on Christmas night. It
was ono of those “East Lynne” “the
child 1s with its mother in London"
pieces, and when the compapy 'strag-
gled {nto the town at midday the loca)
theater manager was at tho station, to
be sure they had the eight actors. +

The players wandered about the town
during the doy. Ths curtain went up on
$24.70, most of it in tho gallery. Some
,of tho $24.76 went out at tho end of
tho second act and didn't come back.
When the final curtain came down a
weary crowd scattered to the chill
dressing rooms, wondering if the hotel |
proprigtor would stopithem at the sta-
tion the next morning. . :

This speculation was at fts height
when the theater manager of the town
appeared, his arms Oiled with bundles,
and dumped them Into the arms of the
youngest member of the tronpe.

“Say! be blustered, apparently'a Jit-
tle ashamed of what he was going to
say, “you people -are having rotten
lock, ain't you? I'm all alone up at
my house. Como up and have supper
with me, will you? And, say, I've had

A bean bag is‘almost a jolller play-
mate than a bal. Why, does a child
ask? Just because it never runs nway
and loses itself as a ball does so often
when it goes rolling off alone to see
the world. A bean bag can't roll, and
40 it is nearly always ready to play
when a child is ready. You can make
your own bean bag. too, some rainy
afternoon when you are not able to go
out in the garden to play. Strong red

J and white striped ticking sewed care

fully with small stiches in n donble
squnre which measures about six
inches on each side Is the best cover
for n bean bag, and it should be flied
two-thirds full of dried peas or beans
Another and a prettier cover for a bean
bag is made of quite strong unbleached
cotton and it is: decorated with some
bright flowers cut from scraps of
chintz or coples ‘of “your Noah's Ark
animals cut from black cambric These -
little picture figures should be sewed In
over and over stitches to the white
bean bag cover. When yon have made
as many ns eight or ten fine, new bean
bags you are ready to invite all the
children from the house next door for
an afternoon of pleasant bean bag
somes. »

An empty wooden soap box may be
transformed by a clever boy Into a

splendid bean bog board, quite as

strong and pretty as any which you
can boy at a toy shop, One end dnd
the two sides should be knocked off
the box, and the remaining end must
be braced to the bottom by some strips”
of wood taken from the other end

Threo holes varying In size and one
above the. other are then cut with a
circular saw in the bottom, and the
entiro board is painted red. The
game is played lke that of ringing
hoops on a stake ;

“Bean bag puss in the corner” is the
Jolliest sort of a bean bag gnme. Each
child” chooses a tree for hls corner.
and half the playars are provided with
bean bags. iOne child tosses a bean
bag to a child at an opposite tree, im.
mediately running «toward his, oppo-
nent’s tree. The other child tries to
catch the bean bag and reach the
thrower’s tree first. As n great many
bean bags may be flying throhigh the
alr at once; the game will prove a
Whole lot.of fun for a group of chil-
dren. 4 Xi
* “Bean: bag call” is a fine gamo to
play ‘on a lawn or in’ a (eld some

warm his Qogers and toes. One child
who 1s “it” tosses a bean bag In the
air and at the same time calls quickly

Both skillful and amusing is the '
Chris 3 gumo of “mixed pickles.” Ev
cry ono knows how difficult it is to get
one’s favorite piece of pickle out of tha

“pickle jar, and it was :his fact which

suggested the game to its foventor
The players are provided with a couple
of “plekle forks,” which very much re
semble knitting needles. "Armed with
these, the competitors take thelr seats
around tho table, in tho center of
which is tho pickle jar. In front of
cach player a little beap of “pickles”
