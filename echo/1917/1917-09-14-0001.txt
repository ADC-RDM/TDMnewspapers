The “circus” held at the summer
home of Mr. and Mrs. V. L. Price,

day, which was the day set for the
affair, postponed it to Saturday. Ev-
erything was arranged in sevens. The
admission was seven cents, there were
seven chief attractions, seyen vaude
ville acts, etc. The grounds and home
of Mr. Price were transformed into n

| veritable circus encampment, the in-

ner ring being the large dining hall

[of the home, and around about housed

in tents were the several side shows
