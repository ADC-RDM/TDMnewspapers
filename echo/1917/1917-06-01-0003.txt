TWENTY SIX-FOOTERS
A Startling Exgmple rol How Oats

“Archdeacon Sifclair, in advising boys to
eat much oatmeal, said this pS ATiong my
brothers and my father's brothersand sis-
ters there were 20 six-footers, all bronght
up on oatmeal."

Oats contain more body-building food,
more brain-building food, more nerve-build-
ing food than any other grain that grows.
No other item in nll human diet compares
importance with oats. = Nothing else
creates so much energy.

But thonsands of people buy this food
_arelessly. They accept oatmeal made
from oats as they run—the plump and the
small, the richiand the worthless.

Quaker Oats is made from the creai: of
the oats, selectediby 62 siftings. Only ten

unds ina bushelare good enough for usd

n this food.® Tho result is a richness and
flavor that all enjoy, and the maximum
value as {God, -

. Yet Quaker Oats, despite its quality, costs
but one-half cent pee dish, Does it pay to
take something inferior? y
