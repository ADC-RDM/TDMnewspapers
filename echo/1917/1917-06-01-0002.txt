A Well Known Resident of Port
Hawkesbury is Restored to '
Health and Strength

One of the best known men in the
town of Port Hawkesbury, N. S.. is
Willlam Duff. He hos been a member
of the municipal council for 14 years,
chairman of the school board, and held
other responsible positions, Mr,
Duff's words, therefore, can be taken
as coming fromi a man who bay the
esteem and respect of hig fallow-
townsmen. He makes no Beret of
the fact that he believes Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills saved his lite, and’ thy, they
restored him to good health, green
several medical men had falls to
cure him. Mr. Duff tells of his ill
ness and cure as follows: "About
four years ago I was attacked With la
grippe which loft me In a condition
difficult to describe. 1 was atigoked
with general weakness, and a con-
stant dull pain in the stomach. 1 be-
came so weak that I'could not Walk
one hundred yards without Sitting
down to rest. The food I ate contin-
ually soured on my stomach. My
nerves were all gone, and palpitation
of the heart and a fluttering sensg.
tion dll through my chest, especially
at night was almost unbearable. 1
was finally compelled to go to body
and called In a doctor, who sald my
heart was affected, and treatod me for
that trouble. After three months -at-
tendance, and feeling no better I call-
ed in another doctor. His treatment
also fafléd to help me, and I tried a
third doctor.. This one sald there was
nothing wrong with my heart, that the
trouble was due to my stomach. Af-
ter treating me for a time he advised
that 1 go to the hospital at Halifax,
On a previous occasion when I hand an
attack of rheumatism I had been cur-
ed by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and 1
decided that rather than BO to a hos-
pital I*would again try this medicine,
L got a supply of the pills and began
taking them. In a few weeks I could
feel my strength returning, my stom-
ach was giving me less trouble, the
Palpitation ‘of the heat disappeared;
and after a further use of the pills/'1
felt as well as ever I did in my life.
I can truly say that I feel more thank.
ful than words can express for what
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have done
for, me.”

You can get these pills from any
dealer in medicine, or by mail at 50
cents a box, or six boxes for $2.50
from The Dr. Willilams' Medicine Co.,
