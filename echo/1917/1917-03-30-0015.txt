South Hssex, moved for return of all
correspondence between the Qovern-
ment of Ontario, or any member or of-
ficial; and thé Devonshire Race Track
Company, and in particular the cor-
respondence between J. T. White, so-
licitor to the Dopartment of the Pro-
vinclal Treasurer, and Hon. Dr. Rea-
ume.

Mr. Wigle sald they had plenty of
raco tracks In the city of Windsor,
One race track had been situated there
for some years, but last year two more
race tracks were established in the Ny
locality. Each was operated for 14 ‘
days which made continuous racing in
the city of Windsor or in that vicinity } 1
for 42 days. Previously there were :

three race tracks imposed upon us?
In this time of war we need every bit
of our energy and strength for the suc-
cessful prosecution of the war. The
professional race track gamblers live
there for six weeks of the year. The
people don't want them. Men are
taken from the farms, when they
would be better employed, and spend
their time on these tracks. In this
time of war this should not occur. If
ever there was oo time when we
should cut out this racing, it 1s now.”

the charter had the right to race in
the province. Mp. McGarry then went
on to talk of what {8 known as the
Miller bill of 1910, which undertook to
legislate for these race tracks {n the
Dominion of Canada. The) effect of
that legislation was that every charter
J In existence prior to 1912 that per-
mitted racing was allowed by the
criminal code. to race and that race
meetings could be held on the tracks
of companies holding those charters.
Heo believed that the chiet fault was
that no investigation as to the number
of old charters lying around the coun- |*
try unused was held. - >
“They «dealt with ¢harters ‘which
were In existence,” said Mr. McGarry;
J but they did not deal with charters
which were lylng around unused at
that time. The result was, of course, i
that "the passage of ‘that bill instead i
of doing away with racing in the
