Coa Ns THE :
AUDITORS’ REPORT

—OF THE-—

Town of Amherstburg for 1916.

 

To the Mayor, Reeve and Members of Council,
Town of Amherstburg,
Amherstburg, Ont.

Gentlemen, —Under appointment by the Municipal Council of the Town
of Amherstburg, I' have mad® an audit of the books and accounts of the Muni-
cipality for the year 1916.

The accounts of Public School Board, High School Board, R. C. Separate
School Board, amd Public Library have been audited for the year 1916. State-
ments of the different School Boards are attached,

Local Improvements.

A statement of advances on different Local Improvements {8 shown {in
Schedule 10.- No attention has yet been paid to the amount uncollected in
connection with By-law 652-B reported on last year, This now amounts to
$1,124.91, as shown In Schedule 8. The council should get legal advice and
collect this, or write It off.

The wohedules of Local Improvement by-laws are not written up in the

| book provided for thnt purpose with the exception of the Richmond street

pavement schedule, which was partly written up by the Clerk while the books
were being nudited a year ago. No attempt to write up any of the others
lias been made since '

 

: Water Works.

The accounts of Water and Lighting were all Included together In.the
early part of 1916 and have not been separated: Now that the street lighting
i8 not done by the town, there is no excuse for not keeping a separate ac-
No entries have been made charging the
town for the ise of hydrants and crediting the Water Works.

The Water Works should be charged with all materials and labor expend-
ed and: should” get credit for hydrant rental, free water given by the town to
any public institutions. water used {in Town Hall, etc, It is absolutely neces.
sary to keep the accounts in the proper way and make proper returns to the
Bureau of Industries before the town can get its portion of 19156 and 1916
Railway Tax from the Ontario Government, which has -been held back be-
cause the proper retawns have not yet been made.

The water rates are in better shape than ever, the uncollected are less
than at any previous audit,

By-Laws. $ 7

Not one by-law passed In 1916 is recorded in the By-law Book,

The Ly-law striking: the rates for 1916 {8 not entered in any book, the
amounts to be raised for tthe different purposes do not appear in the minutes
of the council, and the by-linw presented to me is not completed. There are
changes in figures, most off which are In pencil, and it Is not signed "by the
officials.

 

Officers’ Bonds.

Bond of Gordon E., Pullford—$3,000.00 in Canadian Surety Company.

Bond of J: H. Pettypledie, Collector Water Rates-—$1,000.00 in Dominion of
Canada G. & Accident Insurance Company.

Bond of J. H. Pettyplewme, Collector of Taxes—=$2,000,00 in London & Lan-
cashire G. and Insurance Company.

These bonds are In Imperfuil Bank for safe keeping. >

Niew Library.

No action Has been taken om the $212.44 carried over since 1914, The
Secretary of the Library states (that this was to be taken care of by the
Town, as the first debenture of tthe issue was not sold. The council should
pass a resolution in regard to thiis if the town Is to assume the amount,

Accounts Payable.

All amounts that could be asicertained as owing by the town are included
in Schedule 11 with the excepticon of an account of Echo Printing Co. for ad-
vertiging tax sale;“and tax smile commission due the Treasurer.

Rentals.

No rent for scales was collected in 1916. Mr, Grant ‘'was.scen by the
Reeve and myself, and {3 to) pay $28.00 to December 31st, 1816, to the Treas-
urer.

 

 

Taxes.

The tax rolls are not completed and delivered to the Collector as early
as they should be, causing dellay in getting out the notlces,

The 1915 tax roll was not returned to the Treasurer till after May 1st,
1916, the time on which Interrest over 5 per cent, and not exceeding 10 per
cent. can legally be added to (taxes then unpald.

The council should take actiion at once and see that the 1916 tax roll is
returned to the Treasurer before: May 1st, 1917, otherwise money Is lost to
the, Cofporation and arrears of tmixes allowed to Increase.

The council should anmuallyy 5 on the settlement of the tax roll. If
this received the ottention it shitould-a number of the taxes in arrears would
then be adjusted and not allowesd to accumulate from year to year,
3 Arrrears of Taxes.

The arrears of taxes book weritten up by me during the audit a year ago
in which the Treasurer should huave entered all 1915 taxes against lands re-
turned unpaid when the toll of 19316 was returned August 14th, 1916, had none
of the 1915 arrears entered by. tiige Treasurer. They have now been entered
by me during this audit.

Bach ratepayer against Whose land unpald 1915 taxes were returned to
the Treasurer should. be nottified that the taxes were returned uncollected,
See. 119, Chap. 185.7R. 8, O). 1914. This was mentioned in my 1916 report
cud the Clerk was told about tihis last year, but no atténtion was paid to the
notice being sent.

For some payments of arrrears of#taxes no duplicate receipt appears in the
Treasurer's receipt book prayv{ded for that purpose, find some, duplicate re-
celpts that appear are writiten in pencil. The Treasurer knows that dupli-
cate receipts are required by ithe Act, as he made them in former years,

No date of payment was; mentioned nor does any duplicate receipt ap-
pear to show when some aff the items entered -by the TreaSurer in the ar.
rears of tax book were puifd; some of these have not been entered in the
Town Cash) Book. All that; are entered in the Town Cash Book have not been
deposited Inthe Bank. Stihedule 16 shows amounts due the Town by the
Treasurer. !

Arrears of taxgs are nit entered at all on the current tax rolls, nor do
the Assessors returns in colipegtion with arrears seem to lhiave been complied
with, LR

 

 

Tax Sale.

Arrears of taxes of the. year 1912 dnd former years were advertised for
sale, the publication formgpjijties were complied with:

Until I insisted on thie particulars of each piece of property with descrip
tion, years of taxes, and fymount belpg entered in Land Tax Sale Book which
the Treagurer had In hifs office, no entry at all appeared. in the book.

The Treasurer madis a memo on the copy of advertisement in “Gazette”
of land tax sale of paymgints of taxes on descriptions of property which were
offered for sale and on Wihifch he received payment of money, but no copy of
any recelpt appeared in {the office of thé Town Treasurer, nor did dny éntry
appear for any money rrecelved on Tax Sale In the Town Cash Book till
entered by me. «The money stated to have been.received by the Treasurer
on Tax Sale amounted to $52%5 40, Of this $522.70 was deposited in the Im-
perial Bank in the name of Qiordon E.:.Pulford, special. ® Sec. 225, Chap, 192;
R. S. 0. 1914, requires all aCizounts of municipal funds to be deposited in the
name of the corporation. I had the Treasurer transfer the $522,70 to the
Town of Amherstburg. actount in the Imperial Bank. "oe

The Act states In R. S. 0.71914, Chap. 195, ‘Sec. 137, that the Treasurer
of every municipality ha¥[ng power to sell land for taxes is required to keep
dupligate blank receipt hook, giving the original tg the person paying taxes
and retaining the duplicajte./ :

There is absolutely mo ‘excuse for such glaring negligence of duty as has
been shown by yaur Trépsurer during the year 1916. In"my report dated
March 11th, 1916, appears; the follbwing paragraph of

“The Clerk and Tresmgurer should carefully read the Acts in connection
with Arrears of Taxes being placed on the Tax Roll, also in connection with
Tax Sale.” of

It is claimed that for- some of the lands advertised for tax sale receipts
have been produced shiowiing that the taxes, for which the land is offered for
gale, were pald some yearns ago.

Some description of pravperty Included in the tax’sale for taxes up to and
including the ‘year 1912 whiua Have since been paid, hitve unpald taxes for
subsequent years yet unpaid. Tie parties paying these should have been in-
formed of the 1913, 1914 and 19%5 arrears when they were paying amount as
per Tax Sale. = =

: Street Lighting System. _

The street lighting system has, boen extended and improved at a cost of
over $3,600.00. I am Informed It way the Intention to spread this expense
over a number of years by Issuing debentures, and was not provided for in
the taxes of 1916. 3 { :

If debentures are sold for $3,500.00 the financial position as shown In
Schednle 1 will be improved by the amount realized. wn ¢

Fines. :

The efforts ot the Chiet of Police and Reeve have fatied w procure the
Police Court Record I'cok. The records kept by W. ‘I. Wilkinson in his
private books have been groduced and verified. . a

The Town should either get the Record Bood or furnish’ the Police Mag-
{strate with a new one, otherwise loss will be occasioned and a penalty

liable to be Imposed on tho officials. ) .
Schools. .

Tho accounts of the different School Boards are given In Schedules 8,

The By-law Book las not had one by-law. entered during the year.

The Arrears of Tax Book had none of the arrears of 1916 Roll entered
until ds by me during this audit. 2
The Tax Sale Book had no entry of any items In connection with the
lands advertised for sale until thelr entry was insisted on by me.

The schedule of Local Improvement By-laws has only that of one by-law,
Richmond Street pavement, entered. :

Receipt duplicates did not appenr for a number of the Items entered in
the Cash Book as received by the Treasurer from different sources, There
should be a duplicate receipt for each item, 3

A number of arrears of taxes payments were made to the Treasurer for
which there is no duplicate receipt in the office. ”

There is not one duplicate receipt for money collected on {tems In con-
nection with the Tax Salé.

Monoy has been collected by the Treasurer which has not been deposited
in the Bank.

. All municipal funds deposited In Banks must be In accounts In the name
of the Corporation.
Conclusion.

With conditions existing as has been mentioned above ft. {8s Impossible to
know what moneys have been puld for which receipts have been given with-
out any entry appearing in the books. Some receipts have been produced
showing that taxes were pald on lands for the years for which they are ad-

vestised for sale.
No municipality should permit Its affairs to be conducted in the manner

in which those of the Town of Amherstburg hove been run during the year

1916.
The council should see that all persons against whose lands taxes have

been roturned unpaid for 1915 and previous years, are notified without further
delny.

If the Town pave better remuneration for their officials and insisted on
the work being properly performed they would save hundreds of dollars
each year. v

1 will be pleased to furnish the council further information in connection
with anything contained in this report, if desired.

Yours very truly,

No duplicate recéipts or stubs can be found for amount: collected by the
Treasurer, for cemetery lots, cigarette licenses, junk Ifcens :s, nor for some
{tems of taxes marked: paid in*the Arrears of Tax record by the Treasurer
There should be a duplicate recelpt in the Treasurer's office ‘for all money he
receives from ratepayers. 4

All records available have been checked against the Treasurer's books,
hut where no duplicate 'r pts are kept it is Impossible to téll what receipts
may have been issued by the Treasurer for which no entries appear in the
Cash and other books, i ’

Notices have been sent out in duplicate and turned over to the Mayor
to have them delivered or mailed to all ratepayers against whose property
there Is any record of unpald taxes, up to and including the taxes of the year
1916. The duplicate can be delivered” by the Assessor unless the taxes are
paid ‘before that time. The 1916" Tax Roll is still in ‘the Collector's hands.
When {tds returned the Clerk must send the notice to all ratepayers agpinst
whose lands taxes of 1916 are returned unpaid, in accordance with sub-section
2, section 119, Chapter 195, R.S.0. 1914. The. present Clerk has complied
with this for 1915 taxes,

 

 

Gordon E. Pulford.

My audit report to December 31st, 1916, showed $147.42 due the town from
Gordon E. Pulford. Since then he has deposited $87.62 to apply on above;
but has not deposited $48.884raceived on April 30th, 1917, from'F. H. ‘A. Davis
in payment of Arrears of Taxes as per receipt (ssued op’ that date. He is also
charged with $9.16 of Arrears.of Taxes marked pald but not accounted for.

The ‘attached statement shows Gordon- E. Pulford: owing the Town of
Amherstburg $117.84, made up of cash:received by him and not deposited in
the Bank, amounting to $40.40, and’ items marked paid by him in Arrears of
Thx and other books and overpayment to the amount of $77.44. Should any
receipts have been issued for {tems not recorded In the books, any’such items
would have to be added to the $117.84 due tho town.

The council have passed an orddr for salary to.May 15th, 1917, for $20.83,
which should apply against the above amount.

There are some commissions due to Gordon E, Pulford on items included
in the Tux Sate, which have béen peld and the money deposited in the Bank.
The total amount of commission to the Treasurer including the excess of
printing onthe Items paid In connection with Tax Salo is $63.43, This amount
fs due Gordon E. Pulford if the Town has to’ gssume the cost of printing in
connection with the Tax Sale,” This Is a miter the council will have to
adjust. g ns’

Sigs Taxes, ni

The 1916 Tax Roll lias not been returned,, This should be done Before
the 'new.roll is placed in the Collector's hands, . ia

There are some arrears of taxes that should have the attention of the
council and If they are uncollectable, they should be written off so that at
the end of 1917 a proper statement of the arrears can be made and tax ar-
rears placed on the 1915 roll In akcordance with the Act. :

It would be advisable to clear up some properties {dcluded in the Tax
Sale by the Town buying them In and disposing of them, so as to produce
taxes.

 

 

Scales. \
There Is $28.00 due to December 31st, 1916, for scales, which has not
been collected. A
Licenses.

The Clerk should use the form provided for all licenses and see that the
stub is filled out in every case,
Cash Books.
These have been entered up to June 1st, 1917, and the Treasurer instruct.
ed as tothe way they are to be kept. “yr

Conclusion. i
Tho new Clerk and Treasurer ins been Informed that he is at liberty at
any time to write me should he require any information in regard to any
matters In. connection with the Municipality, and he will have a prompt

TERPONBO. 0.
I will bo pleased to furnish any further information, or assist the Muni-

cipality or any of its officials at any ‘time.,
