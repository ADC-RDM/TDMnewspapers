roncession of the Township of Mauls

s road «olled the Lake Shore Road.
In part known particularly as the
Morin farm, which -wns scquired, in
1903, one Joseph Caldwell was admit-
ted before me to have a one-half jn-
divided interest,

The plaintiff Robert Goodchild was
married in 1888, when 28 years of age,
and left the farm where he had work-
ed for sixteen years. After an ab-
sence of 2 yéard ie was prevalled up-
on to return by his father, who prom-
jeed him the 70 nercs north of the
Lake Shore Road: After n.few months
spent In n small hange on the Morin
farm, Robert Hullt for himself a house
at his own cost on the 70 acres and
has lived there continuously since.
During the period from 1900 to the
present time he has been insole ocon-
pation of this farm. He applied aav-
eral times to his father for.o convey:
ance of the land, b ¢'the father put
Him off on one ground or anothér and
died without fulfilling his promise.

The form south of the rond “was
from the time it wand ecquired until
18909 or 1910 the family hame. James
married in 1907, and brought his wife
to live with his parents. His brothers,
William and Louf#, when not.!awa:

“Yom have always stood, by’ me,

southerly half of the Morin farm and |

the 48 acres of earller purchase which
lay south of the Luke Shore road.

The northerly half of the Morin
tap'm wos regarded as owned by an
uncle of a plaintiffs, one Joseph
Caldwell. It appears. that although
the conveyancesof the’ hundred ncres
was to John R. Goodchild, ‘the grantee
was to have an undivided interest in
the land a trustee for Joseph Caldwell
This was admitted by all parties at the
trial,

child remained upon it, and thereafter;
assisted at times by his father, culti-
vated with ft the Morin farm.

In 1909 the plaintiffs mother died,
and soon afterwerds their father mov-
ad to, 0 house which he owned In Am-
herstburg: His daughter, Med. Wilcox,
accompanied him, and she and her |
husband were living withy him when,
a week before his death, he executed
& series of deeds anda will.

The. plaintiffs seek a declaration
that the lands on which they are re-
spectively in possehsion are owned by
them rospectively, and that the #on-
vayance of such lands to Heir sister,
Annle Wilcox, dated: February 23rd,
iy is Invalid and {8 a cloud upon the

6.of thé plaintiffs. They also ask

be. | that the will of John R. Goodchild be

| At the close of the trial i entertain:

edino doubt as to the effect of the
Jevidence, It was manifest that neither
the conveyances nor the will could
stand. But as.a judgment to that ef-
oI tech would leave many matters relat-
ing to the estato of the deceased unde-
