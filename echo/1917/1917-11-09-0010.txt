A GREAT DRAWING TEAM.

By Augustusi¢Bridle.

A good drawing team is just as much of a joy to the man
that owns ithas it. used to be in the bush-log“days. /We talk a
good deal—some’of us—about the great horses we usefl to handlé™
the ribbons over in the bush, lifting out great loads of elm logs,
sometimes 1,600 feet or 2,000, sometimes more, according to the
man who was telling it, from the stump to the skidroad and the
concession line. i

Certainly some of those teams could draw; and surely some
of thelr drivers did use to be able to talk" about it. But there
are more good average hauling teams in the country now than
there were in the bush days. Farmers have gone in for special
izing on draughts and roadsters, because they undersfand that uo
poor team Is bad economy when work has to be donedn a hurry.
Getting stuck with a load in the flelds is a dead te of time *
und of temper. We used to be stuck often Inthe olf days with
some of those poor teams picked up any old way at“an auction
sale. But a good span of Clydes or Percherons noyoadays is a
renal plece of insurance against wasting time with: stuck” loads.
The only thing that happens in that line with such{horees .is

to’ conscript wealth, resources, or

POTATO STARCH.

Just How to Make It From Unmarket-
able Spuds.

Bruised and otherwise unmarketable
potatoes may be used in making potato
starch. a very desirable and healthful
100d. «

Potato starch can be used in many
ways for food purpose—in making sal-
nds, puddings, milk dishes. ete, “In
every potato section of the country
rhousands of bushels of potatoes are
.wasted every year which could just as
well be utilized in making potato
starch. oi
Use plenty of water and a vegetable
scrubbing brush in washing the pota-
foes. Seat yourself in a convenient po-
sition with a vessel containing potatoes
nt ono side and an empty vessel for the
gratings on the other. Place a digh-
pan with gratér on a low table and,
without removing the skins, grate your
potatoes by hand or run them through
the sausage grinder. Empty gratings
into second tub or vessel. i
Over the gratings pour clean water.
Stir well! so us to saturaté cvery par-
jicle of the potatoes. Allow to stand
for a little time and then remove the
peelings and other floating material
from the top of the water. Stir again,
udd a little more clear water and allow
the same to stand for several hours or
overnight. , The starch” granules will
settle to the bottom. and all pulp and
potato skins will rise to the top of the
| water or settle on top of the starch
granules. Remove the water carefully,
also the pulp and skins. Scrape the
| dark coatgpff the top of the starch for-
mation, being carefol not to remove
any of the stareh.

A second time pour fresh clean water
over the starch. Stir thoroughly. Al-
low tostand for several hours or over-

‘night. Remove water and pulp as be-
fore and add another application of
water, Continue this as often as nec-
casary to render your starch perfectly
white and free, not only from the pulp,
but from all sand or sediment of any
kind which 1s not pure starch.

This operation can be abbreviated by,
rinsing the first time and then strain.
Ing the pulp, starch and water through
cheesecloth or cloth of finer mesb.—

To this Sir Wilfrid adds:

“As to the present Military Service
Act, my policy, will be not to proceed:
further under its provisions until the
people’ have an opportunity, to pro-
nounce on it by way of ao .referen-
dum. I pledge myself forthwith to
submit to the people, and with my
followers to carry out the wishes of
the majority of the nation as thus
expressed.” y- x

As remedies for an economic aitun-
tion “which {5 admittedly critical,”
Sir Wilfr'd Laurier promises: Tar
iY ‘reform, control of food supplies =
and prices, and* a stop to profiteer-

Ing.”

Remove Excess Tariff,

The two increases to the tariff
mude since the beginning of the war,
he would remove, These are 734-per
cent. on all commodities coming info
Cnnada from outside Great Britain,
and 5 per cent. on goods coming
from Great Britain . He also would
Temove the duties on agricultural im-
plements and other essentials as de-
manded by the western farmers.”

In connection with the high cost of
living, he_would “take drastic steps
to bring under Government control
all food-producing factories; «go. that
food may be sold at a fixed  priee
under the control of the Govern-
ment.” If satisfactory arrangements
could not be made with the food»
producing factories, Sir Wilfrid de-
clares® he would not hesitate to com-.
mandeer. g

The .manifesto . progeeds:

End to Profiteering;

“One .of the most important con-
tributions towards winning the war
is to.put a stop to profitéering on
war supplies. The Government has
deliberately’ encouraged profiteering
for the benefit of its partisan follow- °
ers. A first duty of my administra-
tion would be to)insure to the coun->
try which pays for war ‘supplies; the
excess of exorbitant profits beng
belig® realized by profiteers.” ~ If
necessary, Sir Wilfrid continués, he
would not hesitate to take control
of the factories engaged. in the mau-
ufncture of war materials... Suitable
Government. shops.qalso, Sir Wilfrid
believes, should be- ‘turned to the.
production of war materials at cost
prices. y :

Reopen C. N. R. Case.

Sir Wilfrid passes in review alike
some of the legislation of the Iate
Government and the program of the
present. He finds no trace fn’ the
manifesto of the Unoin Government
that its Liberal members haye in-
fluénced thelr colleagues to the adop-
tion of measures they deemed essen-
tial. . He refers to “mast of the art-
fcles” In that “ manifesto ag’ “stale
commonplaces + - resufgected
for “a new election.” He-deglares
of the war-time election act passed

cated upon by the new parliament.
