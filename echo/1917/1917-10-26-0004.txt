Loiselleville.

The Parish of Lolselleville, one of
our good French-Canadian parishes,
of the diocese of London, was cele-
brating Sunday and Monday, October
14th and 15th, a double anniversary
very: joyous for all—the 50th annivers-
ary of the birth of their pastor, Rev.
J. "A. Loiselle, and his 25th annlvers-
ary of the priesthood, The parishion;
ers of Lofselleville and the French-
Canadians of the other parishes of the
county would have been anxious to
make at thi§ ocedsion a. pageant day
but
the two tombs, of Fathers St. Cyr and
Beaudoin of regretted memory, are
not: yet closed enough, and” the eir-
cumstances too tragic to let them-
selves go at great rejolcing.. Never:
theless the parishioners of Lolselle-
ville did not want these two great
events to pass without giving to the
brave jubilarian a tangible. proof of
gratitude for all he has done for them,
Miss Clara Gauthler, the organist, al-
ways devoted to the temporal welfare
of the church, organized for that day
a splendid. program, which was exe-
cuted with complete success in the
auditorium of the imposing parochial
church. As all was to be done In the
greatest intimacy, In family we might
gay, no inyitation was sent, and only
few intimate friends among the peigh-
bors came to join In the celebration.
The parishioners took occasion of the
first represention -on Sunday to ex-
press their-gratitude and present their
good wishes, An addres was read by
Ernest Bondy. accompanied by a
well-filled purse. The drama “Therese
lo Fratricide” was executed with
such great success by the local tal-
ent that its = repetition on Monday
night brought a great number of
strangers. from Windsor, Walkerville,
Sandwich and Amherstburg. Appro-
priate speeches were made and all the
young ladies wito took part in the
drama received their well deserved
share of felicftations. All those who
assisted at those quiet but touching
celebrations will long keep in their
hearts a consoling remembrance.
Father Loldelle, although caught by
surprisé, unaware that the drama was
to be played nt he occasion of this
double anniversary, answered in* a
jovial manner, but his remarks caused
many tears. Through The Echo once
more we, the parishioners of Lofselle,
ville, wish™t6 extend to our esteemed
pastor onr sentiments of gratitude,
and we pray that God will spare him
many years yet among us. May he
enjoy a little rest and comfort after
his eight years of arduous work in
the parigh. The splendid Studebaker
roadster, which replaced the old Over-
land in his garage, will giye him an
opportunity to do so. We want you
to enjoy it.—The wedding bells rang

‘Why Canada N
More Money

to date the war has cost Canada about $700,000,000.
Canada has spent in Canada over $400,000,000 on her own account.
Canada has spent in Canada on behalf of Great Britain over $300,000,000.

What Canada spends for-Great Britain is really loaned to Great Britain
and will be repaid or credited to Canada later on. \

UF

Great Britain needs so much ready
cash to finance her own expenditures at
home for herself and for our Allies that she
must buy on credit from Canada, and from
every other country where she can get
credit.

Of course Great Britain's credit is so
good that other countries, in order to get her
trade, are quiteas willing to give her credit
as we are in Canada.

Canada wants to help Great Britain
not only because Canada wants Britain's
trade but because we are Canada and she is
Great Britain—both members of the ‘same
great Empire; kin of our kin, our. mother-
land.

For Canada it is both a ‘filial and
patriotic duty to supply Great Britain's
war needs and rememniber, her needs are our
needs. Also it is in Canada's self-interest
to supply those needs and thus keep open
a market for our products.

* *

Now, Britain needs our wheat, our
cheese, cattle, hogs, and many manufac-
tured articles. ow Sf

Caxada also needs many of these things
«between the two it amounts to more
than a million dollars a day in cash.

for rent, materials, etc. They must be paid
in cash, or its equivalent. >

~ So Canada says to Great Britain: —*T
will lend you the money so that you can
‘pay cash to Canada's producers for what
‘you want.

“] will borrow this money from our
own people just as you borrow money from
your people.

“1 will also borrow from the people of
Canada money to pay cash for all the pro-
ducts that Canada, as well as Great Britain,

needs in Canada.” :
That is Canada's practical,
part in helping to win the war.
Without this credit the Canadian pro-
ducer could not sell to Great Britain, and
without these Canadian products the war
would be prolonged.

_ So it is necessary for Canada to give
to Gredt Britain the credit in worder that
Canada’s own producers, who need ainarket,
will have one; and in order that Great
Britain which needs the products to win the
war, will get them.

Now how does Canada get the money
by which both Canada and Britain can pay
cash for Canada’s products?

By borrowing it from the people of
Canada ‘through the salewof Canada's
Victory Bonds to beoffered in November.

“That js why Canada's Victory Bonds
are offered to the people—to raise money
to help to finish the war. SURI ne

“Canada must keep her shoulder to the
wheel even though it be a chariot of fire,”
and the way for Canada to keep her
shoulder to the wheel is by buying

And the producers must be paid in
cash. a
Neither Canada nor Creat Britain
could go lo a Canadian farmer and buy
his wheat or Lis cattle on credit.”
The farmer sand all other producers

“country credit but they could not do it
because they have to pay cash for wages,
