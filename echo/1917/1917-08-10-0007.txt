to Inspect the Different Grades and Bridges.

To the Warden and Members of Essex County Council: —

Gentlemen, —We, your committee appointed at the January ®essfon to in-

spect the different grades and bridges, report ns follows: —

We examined bridge over Belle River on the Townline between th
Townships of Rochester and Gosfield North and found the east abutment in
a very dangerous condition, about one-half of which had fallen into the river.
A large hole about four feet wide had washed out on the east end, but has
been temporarily covered. The bridge is in first-class condition, having had
a new plank floor put on two years ago.
Is extremely dangerous, and would recommend that a new abutment be built

as soon as it can possibly be done,

‘We also examined the grade on the west side of the bridge over Canard
River on the Townline between the Townships of
"West. Part of this road was graded Inst year, but has not been properly
levelled, ia full of holes, dnd evidently has not been scraped this year. The

In its present condition the bridge

derdon and Sandwich

balance, which is about 1065 feet, is very low and should be raised.

mencing at the west end of the work done last year there 1s about 200 feet
that would have to be hauled in, then there ia about:300 feet that is wide and
flat, where sufficient earth could be taken from the sides to raise the grade.
The balance, about 665 feat, would also have to bq hauled dn. As this portion
of the road is entirely through the flats of the Canard River, there is.no ma-
terial close by to make the grade. Directly west of this grade there is quite
a, hill where sufficient earth could be procured if the road was the proper
width, but on measuring the road we find it only 48 feet from fence to fence,
As this rond should be the full 66 feet in width, we think that the municipal
authorities of these two ‘townships should establish the proper line for the
It that is done any amount of material would be available to raise

fence.

the grade, and would recommend that the work be done. ~

We further recommend that the grade between Gosfleld South
chester South, between Arner and the lake, be raised. .

Respectfully submitted,
