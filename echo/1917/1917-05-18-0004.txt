been more dainty or more effectively employed; the work-

WOMEN TO VOTE.

 

The explanation in The Echo last
week of the new Franchise Act as ap-
plied to women voters, aroused a good
deal”of Interest, and the question has
been asked if women have a municipal
vote in additign to a legislative vote.
The “Women's Franchise Act 1917"
defines their status clearly,—“There
shall be granted to women the same
right’ to vote at municipal elections as
is possessed by men,” that i8 by own-
ership or tenancy. Interesting subgec:
tions of the Amended Act are as fol
lows: —

(11) Where a married woman is
assessed as owner ofireal property
rated for an amount sufficient to
entitle her to vote at municipal
elections and desires that her hus-
sand shall _be entitled to vote in-
stend of herself she may file with
the assessor, or If there is one, &
the assessment commissioner, be-
fore the date fixed for the return
of the roll, a notice setting out all
the real property owned by her in
the municipality and stating that
she desires that her husband shall

~ have. the right to vote instead of

lverself, and the assessor or assess:
ment commissioner shall there.
upon. enter upon the roll as owner
the name ofthe husband. instead
of the wife.
(11a) If the notite. is not filed as
provided -by subsection 11 a no-
tice to the same effect may be filed
with the Clerk within the time al-~
lowed for.appéals to the Court of
Revision and the Court of Revision
shall fn compliance with such no-
tice add without further evidence
direct the name of the husband to
be entered .on the“roll as owner
instead of the wife

(11b)> In either case the hus-
band shall be entitled to be enter:
ed on the voters’ list as the own:

; er'of the property and to vote. —

It must be kept In mind that in or-
der to get a vote at the coming muni-
cipal’ elections, women must see that
they become possesSed of the requir
ed qualifications, ay to ownership,
ete, and that appedls to .add thelr
names are made to Courts of Revidion
or the Voters’ List Courts, as the case
may be, otherwise there will*be a lot
of dfnppointed women when the time
comes to do what they have wanted
to do "so long—gel an entry into the
realms of franchise. ”

Farmers are a liappy bunch these

prophets, who kept tab on conditions
all April, ‘the ‘cold disappeared and
bright. warm, sunshiny days took their
place, the trees and verdura sprang to
life, the crops sown early began to
make great headway, and all is ac-
tivity on the farms... The soll is work-
ing well for corn and a great deal of
acreage has been planted. Conditions
dotild not be improved on for this crop
at the present, and we are already be-
ginning to forget the hard: year that
hak passed, looking for a FEountiful
harvest.

The Malden ratepayers areal being
asked to sign two petitions, one in
favpr of and one against, opening up
a new road in the Kirit Concession
from 500 to 1,000 feet back from the
river. Judging from the number of
owners in the First Concession op-
posed to the scheme it 100Ka as if it
would be necessary to expropriaté the
greater. partgof the land required for
the néw road and as this would involve
costly arbitration proceedings in nd:
dition to the expense of building the
road after the land was acquired, it
js doubtful whether the councll will
consider the matter. While the loca-
tion of the. road affects principally
those living along the ‘front, when It
comes to an expenditure of public
moneys every riatepayer of the town-
ship is interested: In addition to this
the public generally will be opposed
to closing up this beautiful river front
drive, whic forms one of the most
features of the township,
for a road which will run back of the
houses and in many instdnces through
existing barnyards. In another col:
umn of this Issue appears a letter
from F. W. Patton, advancing strong
arguments in favor of the proposed
change of roadway.

service has its own tense moments, hours or days, with its
welcome Intervals of relaxation when the Gillette is a {riend
