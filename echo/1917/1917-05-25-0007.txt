Those are the days when the more

fn all other things, this is eminently
true. Book-lenrning {8 no longer an
objedt of aneering by the man of prac-
tical experience, He has been forced
to the conclusion that an earnest study
of hooks, pamphlets and bulletins is a
tremendous help to the beginner and
often of tne greatest value to him-
self, In by-gone times poultry-keaping
was of n haphazard nature. If the
hens were healthy and lald in mys-
terfous places all was well. If they
didn’t, the true cause was rarely dis-
covered and the fowl, having seeming.
Jy fafled of their usefulness, were
summarily dispatched. To-day much
of this is changed and poultry-keeping
has become a systematic pursuit per-
mitting of research and subject to ex-
periment, the same way as any other
branch of agricultural industry A

Corn and soybeans may be planted
now to cut green for dalry cows in
midsummer when pastures are short.
Corn for this use is usually planted
a little thicker thanor grain, It may
be ready to cut fn 60 to 80 days from
planting, and can be fed until fall
frost comes,

Soybeans are well suited wo be fed
with corn since they are riclicin pro-
tein. according to the Ohio Agricul
tural Experiment Station. They may
be planted from May 20th to June
20th. In rows 28 to 36 inches apart
three packs of beans will seed an
acre, the crop specialists advise. Med-
{um Green, Ito San. Shingto and Au.
burn are varieties found adapted to
this purpose at the Experiment Sta-
tion. The crop is ready to be cut by
the first of August,
