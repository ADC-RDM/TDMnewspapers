What every mother knows probably includes a
realization of the fact that boys are hard on their
clothes and, knowing that, she wants clothes sold by
a retailer who is aware of the same fact.

This store is aware of these facts. You can see
it in every boy's suit we sell--in woollens, the tailor-
ing, reinforcing and taped seams.

Put our boys’ clothing through the hardest sort
of service test and it will come through with flying

colors. :
We are showing splendid lines of school suits

that spell exceptional values at $3.50, $4.00, $4.50,
