Dear Mary,— :

J Doiyou ever. go into a house where they do mot have any
rocking chairs? I think they are the very soul of a home. It's
missing comfort not to have them. How one can rock, and rock,
and forget their cares! °

I do believe that the way a home in furnished affects the

dispositions of the whole family. I've always noticed that cheer-
ful peaple had cheerfully furnished homes. I'm going to always

: heerful looking.
keep my home chee: & Your devoted—HELEN.

P. S._They Bave such cheerful home furnishings at

The roll of Amherstburg’s honored
dead over whose graves poppies blow
in Rlanders’ fields, i8 a growing one.
Once more flags are flying at half mast

wrung with grief becouse a native son
has fallen in battle. Monday morning
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Meloche, Brock

“regret to fmform you” messages from
the Canadian Records Office at”Otta-
wa, telling them that thelr only son,
Pte. Stanley Mello¢he; had dled Sun-
day, July 29th, inthe Seventh Casu-

the fact that Pte. Meloche’s death

(that time can never efface. The young

man enlisted §n the 99th Battalion at

to bear a charmed Jife. At Vimy
Ridge his exploits were such that word

a week passed but hg wrote at length
to his parents, his gocount of the
evonts being racy, eDiartaining and al-
ways cheerful, TWO jettars have been
received since the t4jegram announc-

_ Wherever you find Ford cars and Ford-service, you find . |
SATISFIED FORD OWNERS—men who appreociato the car

for its quick starting, its easy control, its simplicity and
its extraordinary capacity for hard work. .

The phenomcnally large sale of Ford cars is the direct
result of Ford SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION.

For -sotisfaction is os universal as the Ford car itself.
Doctors, Iewyers, salesmen, bakers, grocers and farmers
all praise the Ford—all are satisfied. Ft

Its 1ow cost appenls to them: Its unusually low upkeep
cost pleases them. Its sturdy, steady, service-giving char-
acter wins them and satisfies them, Even the wealthy
prefér to drive Ford cars rather than botl sr with the cost-
ly, cumbersome limousine and chauffeur. It means econ-
omy when ¥saving is a national duty.”

Ford satisfaction is just ag valuable as upkLolstery, or a
fancy finish. Ask any Ford owner about it.

If jyou intend to buy a Ford, place your order with the
nearest dealer. ¥
