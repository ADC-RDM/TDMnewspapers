CORN EXPERT IS APROINTED
§

The appointment-of P.  L.- Fancher,
as corn expert for Ontario has been
announced. Mr. Fancher ig a mem-
ber of this year's graduating class at
the O: A. C;; and hails from Lambton
county.

In announcing the pending appoint-
ment at the Corn Show last winter,
Dr. G. C. Creelman stated that the
specialist. would devote "his time to
the standardization and development
of seed corn strains (along the line
that Dr. Zavitz works’ with = other
grains at Guelph), and that he would
probably have a close conneétion with
tie Corn Show.

Speculation was rife as to who
would receive the appointment, there
bheing=muny ‘different opinions as ‘to
who was properly qualified. to carry
on this expert work. Dr. Creelman
had explaingd that it was impossible
to do good work at Guelph, where soil
and weather conditions were less. fav:
orable than in the “Corn Belt,” and for
this purpose the work would have to
be carried on apart from the O. A. C:
It was thought that a man already ‘in
touch with the seed corn
would ‘receive ‘the appointment, who-
ever it might be.

Mr. Fancher will come to the work
with an open mind, and will Be able
to make out of the position just what
He wills, If he has the capacity and
tact necessary for the work, much
moy be done for the corn (industry;
if not, it may-turn out to be “Just an-
other Government job.”

At tHe time of the Corn Show, the
announcement of the. pending ap-
pointment of am expert was enthus-
fnstically received, and nothing but
favorable comment was heard. This
speaks well for Mr. Fancher’s recep-
tion, and The Sun joins in the hope
that it spells happier days for the Corn
Show and the seed corn industry.—

SOUTHERN: POTATOES
CAN BE USED IN NORTH
FOR SEED PURPOSES

Since small-sized new potatoes from
southern. states are lower in price than
old stock in_the North, many growers
will be induced to plant them, but un-
less handled sons to hasten germina-
tion results will be disappointing, say
gardeners nt the.Ohlo Agricultural Ex-
periment Station. Such seed planted
under usual conditions will not grow
for many weeks and then irregularly.

Greening the tubers in: partial sun-
light for at least two weeks, or placing
them in cold storage for the same
length of time, brings about the ripen.
Ing necessary for germination. A
quick method 18 to rub off the skin of
the new potatoes and then to plant
them immediately. They will sprout

Need the Rich, Red Blood Dr.

Williams’ Pink: Pills Actu-

Thin-blooded people do not remain
so from choice but from indifference,
in some cnses from despair. People
who are pale, languid, with palpitation
of the heart, some difficulty in breath-
ing and a tendency to be easily tired
are suffering from thin blood.” They
need only the resolution to take the
right treatment and stick to it until
oured. ' The remedy that can be yelled
upon is Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People. With every dose they
make new blood, and new blood means
health and strength. The red cheeks,
good appetite, increased weight and

Here Js an example;
Mrs, J. McDonald, jr., Hay, Ont., says;
“I honestly believe Dr. Willlams' Pink
Pills saved my life. Some years ago
I had anaemia, and as 1 did not realize
the seriousness of the trouble T soon
became a complete wreck. I got so
weak 1 could hardly walk. 1 neither
ate nor slept well, and could not go
up stairs without stopping to rest. At
times 1 had an almost unbearable pain
in my back and would have to remain
in bed. [I suffered almost constantly
from a dull headache, and when sweep-
ing. or 1 would stoop to pick up any-
thing) would get so dizzy that I would
have to catch hold of something to
keep from falling. At times my heaxt
would beat so fast that I would have
a smothering sensation. My eyes
were sunken and nmiy hands and-limbs
would be swollen in the mornings, I
tried several kinds of medicine without
benefit and my friends thought I would
not recover. Then I began taking Dr.
Williams" Pink Pllls, and before long
could see and {i:el that they were +elp-
{ng me. I gladly contivucd the use of
the “pills until "was completely cured
and I cannot say enough in their
praise, and a skronsly recomend them
to all run down girls Anil women.”

WORKING WOME!

They Almost Drop. How
Mrs. Conley Got Help.

Here is a letter Ton 8 woman who

had to work, but was too weak and suf-

fered too much to continue. How she
regained health :—

Frankfort, Ky.— ‘I suffered so much

with female Yealineds that I could not

o my own work,

[I had to hire it done,

I heard so much

about Lydia E. Pink-

bam’s Vegetable

Compound that I

tried it. I took three

bottles and I found

it to be all you

claim. Now Ifeel as

well as ever1did and

| am able to do all my

——— own work again. I

recommend it to any woman suffering

from female weakness. You may pub-

lish my letter if you wish. '’—Mrs, JAMES

CONLEY, 516 St. Clair St., Frankfort, Ky.

No woman suffering from any form of

female troubles should lose hope until

she has given Lydia E. Pinkham’s Veg-

etable Compound a fair trial. s

This famous remedy, the medicinal

ingredients of which are derived from

native roots and herbs, has for forty

years proved to be a most valuable tonic

and invigorator of the female organism.

All women are invited to write
to the Lydia E. Pinkham Medi-
cine Co., Lynn, Mass., for special
advice,—it will be confidential.

BOATS TRAVEL LAKES
FEW MINUTES APART

The tremendous growth of traffic on
the lakes with the past four years
makes it necessary for boats to pass
one another with the regularity of
traing in certain common
lanes of water passage as the Detroit
and St. Clair rivers.

A. A. Schantzy general manager of
the Detroit & Cleveland Navigation
Co.) estimates that boats pres every
seven minutes between Detroit and
Cleveland; every nine mjnutes aon the
route between Detroit and Buffalo,

and every fourteen ‘minutes between

Detroit and Mackinaw.

Summer tourists can obtain a know-
ledge of the heavy traffic on the pas-
senger routes of the great: lakes by
making their own estimates and com-

paring them with that mode by Mr.
Schantz. >
