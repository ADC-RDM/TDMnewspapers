AIR BRAKES AND TOILETS

; FOR AMHERSTBURG CARS
J SARE

An interesting scsalon of the On-
tario Railway and Muncipal Board was
held at the city hall, Windsor, Tues-
day, when Chairman D, M. McIntyre
and Commissioner A. B. Ingram heard
the application of Essex county and
other municipalities to compel the S.,
W. & A. electric railway management
to instal alr brakes and tollet  con-
veniences on the cars running from
Amherstburg to Tecumseh. A fight
for these concessions has been going
on for years, and from time to time
applicatipne were made to the Ontario
Railway Board for an order to compel
the Company to act, and it was gener-
ally understood that an order had
been given and Ignored, but this was
not the fact.

However, after hearing

dence. Tuesday, the Board ordered
Mr. Anderson, Manager, to instal both
air brakes and convenlences within
the next six months, ,
, Mr. Anderson explained that he had
some time ago ordered the air brake
equipment, which would have been on
before now bat for the delay in pro-
curing some of the parts. The mat
ter of tofléts will 4nke same time .a8
new and larger cara will be necessary.
Mr. Anderson's evidence went to show
that ‘the cars uséd: were light ones,
and there had never been an accident
due to the fact that hand brakes were
uded, .

The tollet accessories now in vogue
both, for employees and passengers
came up for discussion and the elabor-
ate public toilet, erected by Windsor
‘near the S., W. & A. waiting room
there, wus roasted as being unsani-
tary and {ll kept.
