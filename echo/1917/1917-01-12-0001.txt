CHARPUS TRESPASS CASE.

 

Friction developing between A,
Chappus, owner of a large marsh
hunting ground in Malden, and the
people of Malden and the district gen-
erally is reaching a point where any
In suit growing out off an infraction
of the game law op p-isw of tres
passing develops an interest secont

|to no other matter in the community.

This was evidenced, on ‘Friday and
Saturday of last weak when three
Amherstburg boys—Bellecoure, Mail
loux and Desnutel, appeared before
local Justices Auld “and . Wilkingon;
charged by Mr, Chappus with tres-
passing. The police court was

crowded td the doors every minute of }
the trial, which started at 10 o'clock
that morning, continued until 1.80
Saturday Morning and resumed at 10
o'clock Satuyday, «closing at 1 p, m.
All the time there was “something
doing.” <A number of witnesses were
heard on each gide. The offence was
alleged to have been committed on
14th November |agt, The case was
confined to the Majlloux Boy. Messrs.
Healy; Moore and Chappus swore that
they had headed off these hoys shoot-

ing a quarter of a mile over the
line on thelr {roperty. For the (de-
fence the boy |swore that he was
not on the property. Evidence also

on thelr behalf wag given by Dr. Cam-
peau, Charles Bigeon and C. Quick, of
Harrow, ‘and Fred” Woods, of Am-
herstburg. Thiate was ‘a mask of con-

was not able to sit on the case Fri
day night or Saturday, and Mr. Wil
kinson"nibstponed his decision until 10
6'clock Monday morning, when he an-
nounced that according to the avi-
dence he found the boy guilty of troa:
passing and fmposed the minimum

GOVERNMENT PREDICTING
SERIOUS HOG"SHORTAGE.

Extensive Killing Campaign Followed
by Rising Prices and Scarcity.

The sudden risa in the price of hogs
during the 18st few weeks has brought
to light what the, Government claims
will be a serious shortage of: live
stock, unless immediate stops are
taken to remedy it. Failure of many

crops during 1916 was responsible for
a shortage in the

necessary food:
stuffs. for cattle and hogs. as well as
for poultry. Many farmers and hog-
raisers, ‘because of the.exceptionally
high cost of feeding the animals, dis:
Puad of them immedintely. This
called a drop in price for a time,
but now that the supply Is beginning
to @ll prices are on the rise once

rise of this extent, at least not for a
