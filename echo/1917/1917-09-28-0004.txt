Government Will Not wait for Its
Atitomatic Death on October 7th.

 

Dissolution of Barliament is expect
ed to take place some day next week
Otherwise it would dissolve automati-
cally op Sunday night, October 7th. It
is believed that the Government will
anticipate the event and take the
initiative on the matter. Sir Robert
Borden will likely be back about the
lend of the week, when the decision
| will be reached.
| It is seldom that.a Parliament lives
out its alloted: term. In 1898 Parlia-

It is anticipated. that the date for
slection wil' be fixed about December
3rd or 10th. Nomination day will be
set 28 days prior to this. A good
deal of new machinery will be neces-
gary for the taking of the soldiers’
vote overseas. A solid month will be
occupied in taking that vote and as a
considerable amount of time will be
allocating

constitu

necessary, afterwards in,
the various. ballots to the

itary and civil vate. it will be same
time after election’ day before the re-
sujt fs known. It is conceivable that
{ many results may be considerably af-
fected by the soldiers’ vote
As soon as dissolution occurs enum:
| erators wilh be appointed to revise
the existing lists. These men will sit
| for ten days, at least two hours a day.
“The fact that the lists are not to be
! printed will save considerable time.
