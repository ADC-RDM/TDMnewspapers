A Quebec despatch to the Toronto
Star Monday says a special session
| of the Quebec Legislature will be hel?!
the last week In September, when the
Government will deal with several
important matters, inciuding the
Military Service Act, concerning
which the despatch says, the govern-
ment will take “a most sensational
stand,” and adds: “It {s said Sir
Lomer Gouin is to put before the pro-
vince a most acceptable proposition,
even for the most ardent National-
ists.” The despatch also says this will
be the last Bessfon for Sir Lomer
Gouin, who is slated as successor to
Sir Wilfrid Laurer, as leader of the
Liberal party in Canada. It is claim-
ed that Ontario and the maritime
provinces have already accented Sir
Lomer as the future Liberal leader,
and the support of the western pro-
| vinces Is alsp expected. Sir Lomer's
successor as premier of Quebec will
| probably be chosen at n meeting of
