—It- has long been contended by
those who have to buy eggs that they
should be sold by the pound, not by
the dozen, on the ground that one doz-
en of eggs, and another dozen of eggs
have as n rule no relation when fit
comes to food contents, owing to thelr
difference in size. This question has
been before the public in one form’ or
another, like a hardy perennial, but
those who handle eggs have never had
the nerve to put into practice the
method they know Is a proper one any
more than they regulate the price
of butter according to {its grade,
not welght—Iit's all butter, and there-
fore the same price. If there are any
