The death of two Consarvative Sen-

ators, Senators Baird, of New Burns-
wick, and Senator Corby, of Belleville,
makes eleven vacancies in the upper
house. They will probably be filled
immed(ately after the Premier returns
from England.

The agitation of Lambert Wigle, MM.
P.P.,, against the race track evil is
beuring fruit in the way of greater
production of profits for the Govern-
ment. Hon. Mr. McGarry, Provincial
Treasurer, announced that the 10-cent
assessment tax collected at all race
tracks in Ontario will be Increased to
25 cents, to be operative ‘from May
23rd. The firm of Clarkson & Sons,
of Toronto, have been appointed to
make an Independent audit of the
books of all race tracks. The second
announcement is taken to foreshadow
legislation of more advanced nature

respecting the license fees of race
tracks.

 

The budget speech delivered by Sir
Thomas White in the Dominion
House on Tuesday had some new and
important features regarding taxation.
While there are to be no tariff changes,
which was a surprise, as It was ex-
pected that beans would have been
placed on the free list. The new tax-
ation is an extension of the'business

proposed to take from all persons,

present act 50 per cent. of all profits
In excess of 16 per cent, but not ex-
ceeding 20 per cent. per anpum, and
35 per cent. of profits in excess of 20
per cent, per annum on capital. The
present tax is 256 per cent. on profits
above 73% per cent. Under the new
legislation up to 15 per cent. com-
panies will be taxed at the present rate.
Between 15 and 20 per cent. the Gov-
ernment will take one-half the profits,
and beyond 20 per cent. three-fourths
of the profits, The new legislation
will apply after the ldst accounting

year that the Public school would no
doubt require all the. rooms and thus
leave the High School without a home,
it would therefore be necessary to
