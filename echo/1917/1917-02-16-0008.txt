a grocery account against Joe Matta,
formerly of Amherstburg, now. a
conductor on the Sandwich, Windsor
& Amberstburg Railway, John Scott
grocer, Sandwich street, told Judge
Smith the best response to requests
for settlement he received from de-
fondant had been $15 and a cushion.
He told the court he took the cushion.
Judge Smith was inclined to allow
something for the cushion, but Scott
said it was not much use to him, and
that cash would look better. Judge
Smith then gave judgment for the full
amount of $77 and costs, to be paid in
twenty days.

—The old ground hog certainly had
whis weather eye in line when he came
out on February 2nd and hiked back
to’ his den for another sleepy spell, |
for since that time this town has been
undergoing one of the most virulent
spells of cold weather on record for
many years. © Friday morning the
thermometer sank 0 below with a
severe wind, which made it extremely
cold. Saturday and Sunday hovered
around the zero mark, while. Monday
morning" the lowest temperature in
town was 14 below and In some places |
in the country the mercury stood at
20 below. Fortunately there was no
wind and the cold was not felt =o’
much as on the other days. Owing to
the shortage of coal, no great deal of
suffering has been caused by the se-
vere winter. The weather man prom:
ses better conditions during the rest
of the month.
