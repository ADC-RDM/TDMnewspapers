BIG WASTEAGE OF
EGGS AT HATCHERY

 

Large Proportion of Spawn Bought
Lost Through Different Causes.

 

According to Sandwich flshermen
there Is at least one item in the De-
partmerit of Marine and Fisheries
which Qttawa officials will not be able
to expl@in by blaming the war. This
item, apoounting to $89,358, was lost In
fish egg® In this locality in the past
three years.

It mudt sound worse to the Depart-
ment to hear they have lost 287,860,
000 egg® during this time. Jn 1914
some 113,000,000 eggs out of a total
of 178,000,000 purchased, were lost.
The halmnce, 65,000,000, were shipped
to Kenora: Ont.; Collingwood, Ont.
and Selkirk, Man.

In 19116, the loss totalled 65,360,000,
out ‘of @ total of 130,360,000. Then
the fish hatchery was removed from
Sandwich to Kingsville, where the OER
tragedy was continued during the past
year. lngreased land values at Sand-
wich was’ given as the cause of the
move By local Government representa.
tives, Fishermen say the eggs and
alkali {in the water at Sandwich did
not agree and the eggs got beaten to
a frazzle In the fight for supremacy.

But Kiingaville as a selection by the
Government for a hatchery has noth-
ing to bwast about, as already 115,500,
000 eggui ave been lost ont of a total
of 120,000,000 taken there last fall
from Smndwich, which, in other words,
means that he Government saved only
the. diffference, 2,400,000. Eggs are
bought at $12 per quart of 40,090,

Abouit two years ago when the ques:
tion of moving the hatchery first came
up it wms strongly urged by fishermen
that a ‘hatchery be established at Am-
herstbummg, where there is sheltered
deep water, but the Department decid-
ed on Kingsville, and now the “I4told-
you-s0i” brignde {s busy.

Of thie total of 3,259 quarts of CERS
securadl by the Government In 1915,
Amhmrstburg furnished 1,606 quarts,

 

Kingsville 1,338 quarts, Lake Brie
Fishery 94 quarts and  Bofs Blanc
Island (Government ~ owned) 221

quarits. Thus Amherstburg has a lead
of 2218 quarts, or 105,200,000 CEEBS over

Its nwarest competitor, Kingsville.—
Wiidsoir Record. : :

The Other Side.

On thie other hand, the Kingaville
Reporter claims that the Leaniington
Post and] Windsor Record has not been
fair in their criticism of the Kings-
ville hatghery. It says by way of ex-
planation: — “The hatchery was com-
pleted: late last. fall, and the engineer,
unacQiyainted with local conditions,
placed, the intake Into what he thopght

“Nothing ndds so much to a wo-
man's youth and good looks,” snys a
shion expert, “us a soft fall of lace
ow the chin. Womel of all ages
bave recogrized it, and men In differ-
| ent periods Lave not scorned the lace

Jabot to add to thelr own charms.”

This many be a prejudived view, but
it is true,-and'it Is also certain that
there are to be many soft things in
nets and laces to be worn. and buyers
are ordering them in large quantities
for their different houses,

Furs and laces go together, and, with
the deep fur collars that are to be
worn on all kinds of coats fastened
high in the neck when they are closed,
but turned well back from the throat
when they are open, the Ince is al-
most indispensable. The materials
used are many and varied. There are
fine mulls and lawns, silk nets and
nets of other kinds, fine nets and those
with a coarser mesh, nets with small
"over patterns and nets with lace bor-
ders made In single and double frills
and falling straight or with drop cor:
ners to give the effect of points to
agree with the many pointed effects
that are seen on gowns and coats and
wraps. Georgntte crape Is also much
used.

Silk and satins will be combined
with the softer materials. The smart
black stock will appear with its fal
of cream lace and possibly a little
white above to soften the effect near
the face. There are a few wires nec-
essary to hold the stock in place, but
the general effect fs of the softest.

the things the shops are displaying,
