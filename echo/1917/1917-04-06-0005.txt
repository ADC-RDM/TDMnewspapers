which we have on hand and ready even in Such Strenuous Times. When
many dealers have been unable to procure the goods we have grasped the
opportunity to get in a supply when the opportunity presented itself. This
has not been done without an effort nor without considerable cost. Our cus-
tomers, we are sure, will appreciate the uninterrupted” good service we are
thereby enabled to extend to them. f

Many of our seasonable lines are but slightly over former years’ prices.

 

 

 

You will do well to buy early and provide against any future shortage and
possible advance in price.

John Wall, of John Wall & Co., who
Is asking for an exemption from tax-
ation on thelr proposed corn factory
at Harrow, has initiated and built
more canning factories in Canada than
any other man in the business. He
was the man who started all the fac-
tories for the British Canners, which
have been recently amalgamated with
the Canadian Canners, Limited. It
speaks well for Mr. Wall that not one
of his factories have proved a failure,
but each and every one of them has
been a decided success and the farm-
ers who grew the .produce never lost
one dollar through any of these fac-
tories. Harrow is indeed fortunate in
having two good factories located here
in the course of a year. Both the W.
Clark Co.'s tomato process factory and
the Quality Canners corn factory will
be credit to this village and the sur-
rounding country. It is the intention
of the Quality Canners to specialize
on corn only this year. Peas and
small fruit may be added later, but
sweet corn will be. the main product
almed at. When the factory is fully
equipped Mr. Wall-expects to ‘be able
to handle 1,000 acres, provided the
farmers will go, extensively into the
raising of it. “There is plenty of terri-
tory in and around Harrow to support
two factories such’ as will be bullt
here.

and proved to be a very pleasant and
profitable. meeting. About twenty-five
ladies were present and after listen-

Reports published to the effect that,
it" was proposed to require licenses
from all drivers of motor vehicles in
Ontario are sald to be incorrect. A
despatch from Toronto states that
proposals for licensing all auto drivers
or for requiring all drivers to register
were turned down by .the municipal
committee, and that there is no legis-
lation likely in this direction at this
season. The existing legislation which
requires only professional drivers or
chauffeurs 10 have licenses will hence
remain as at present. It was reported
that legislation was proposed, which
would require owners of cars to take
out licenses in order to drive thelr
own cars, as well as chauffeurs whom
they might employ. Now f(t is an-
nounced that motorists may continue
to drive their own cars without re-
quiring any special license.
