PRESIDENT, SE0'V-TREAS
Friday, April 27, 1917.

A large deputation waited upon the
Government asking that the Toronto-
Windsor highway should run «north
through = Brampton, Georgetown,
Guelph, Ktichener, Stratford and St.
Mary's to London, rather than over.the
Toronto-Hamilton highway. The Prime
Minister said he had an absolutely
open mind in the matter.

 

Free wheat {8s causing considerable
worry to the Canadian railways at the
present time. United States railways
have 24,000 cars on the C. P. R, alone,
on which they pay 45 cents a day and
rétain them indefinitely. The com-
panies ‘think they will lose more on
United States shipments south. Only
3,000 foreign railway cars are at
present in Western Canada.

John Bright, Dominion Live Stock
Commissioner. and president of the
Central Canada Exhibition Assocal-
tion, died at his home in Ottawa Mon-
day. night after an illness of three

Day, when the United States Ii Ta-
tlon Department ‘will enforce the $8
head tax from trdvellers entering that
country, local railway officials are in
doubt as to how far the immigration
officials ¢an go in enforcing the new
measure as an imposition. -, If the
United States Government insist upon
enforcing the new rdkulation, © Can
adian railway officials say they will
have to abide by it. The United States
immigration officials have unlimited
powers and can do what they please
once Canadian trains reach the bor
der points,
How Strict They Will Be?

According to local railway officers,
Chief Inspector Baldwin, at Niagara
Falls, is inclined to be very strict in
his |nterpretation and enforce the
regulation in ell cases. On the other
hand, railway officials think that the
law will not be drastically enforced
against citizens of either country who
are known to be permanent residents.
Not that the United States has thrown
in her lot with the Allies railway of-
cials see no reason for the enforce-
ment of such a law.

The New Regulations.

Following is a copy of the new regu-
lation furnished the railway com-
panies; —

$ At the said tax shall not be

levied on account of aliens who

uninterrupted residence of at

General of 'mmigration with the

ty-three of this act, may ‘arrange
in some other manner for the pay-
ment of tax imposed by this sec-
tion upon any or all aliens seek-
ing admission from foreign con-
tiguous territory.”

Section 2 of the act, in part, states
that there shall be levied, collected

HIGHWAYS IMPROVEMENT

BILL IS UP AGAIN

Liberals Will Again Demand Provin-

cial Control, of Exgenditure.

Now that the Government hus ob-
teined party control of the Senate, and
algo fa view of cn impending general
election, the highways improvement
bill is to be reintroduced. Hon. Frank
Cochrane gave notice on Thursday of
last week of the reintroduction of the
bill to appropriate $10,000,000 to aid
highway construction in the various
Provinces.

The bill was thrown out by the Lib-
eral majority in the Senate four years
ugo, because of the refusal of the Gov-
ernment to accept an amendment pro-
viding for the distribution of the
money among the Provinces according
to population and leaving the Provin-
cial Government to determine on
what roads the money should be spent. |
The Opposition’s claim is that In the
practical working out of the Govern:
ment’s plan of direct Federal super-
vision, the whole grant would be prac
tically? used for political purposes,
serving as a bride to each constituency
which elected a Governmen support
er. The same stand will Be taken
wien the bill comes up again, and a
vigorous fight will be put up to leive
the specific expenditure of the grant to
the Provincial authorities.
