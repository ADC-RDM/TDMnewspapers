1 slice of bread (1/14 of loaf) weighs
1.14 oz. If one million families woste
one slice per week, the weekly total
waste of bread is 1,140,000 oz, or
73,250 one-pound loaves, or enough
for 21:3 divisions for one day, or one
division (21,5600 menn for 3 13 days, or

The tremendous importance of
waste prevention and of food @conomy
is clear. It is appropgiate to touch
briefly on a subject that, in these
times of war, is equally vital—the pos-
sibilities of substituting other staples
for wheat flour. kg

If, once a week, one million Can.
adian families use a one-pound loaf
of _corn, ‘or rye bread instead of &
similar loaf of white, the weekly and
yearly saving would be:

1,000,000 Ms. of white bread; or 700,
000s. of flour; or 3,671 bbls. of flour;
or 16,070 bushels of wheat.

The yearly saving on the same scale
would amount to 62,000,000 ibs. bread;
or 26,040,000 ms. flour; or 185712

he doubted that habits of economy in-
doced by watching carefully the con-
sumption of flour, beef and bacon, will
automatically bring about savings in
all other foodstuffs. Thus the sug-
