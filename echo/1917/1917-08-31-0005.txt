Everything Points to Higher Prices on all Cotton Goods :

Through the steadily increasing cost of materials and “difficulties in deliveries of Saols, through the
‘shortage and enormous cost of labor, embargoes on railways, shortage of cotton crop, and steadily increasing
high prices and demand for same on the mills for cotton cloth of all kinds; and the increasing demand
through the general prosperity of all classes of labor, and the last but most important factor is the UNITED

terest by every member, Harrow ought

F. celebriition in its history. Boost
your village by showing a patriotic
interest in its doings. While this Is
primarily an Oddfellows affair, it is
of direct concern to every person in

heartedly, in this celebration. It is
only thus that the old unselfish spirit
of co-operation can be kept allve, and
working in our every interest,

At the quarterly official board meet-
ing of the Methodist church held
Monday night, Mrs. Eva Clark and O.
J. Bowring, James Bailey and Robert
Watters were appointed to “attend a
missionary convention to be held in
connection with the ‘Windsor District |
meeting in September. This conven-
tion will arrange @ missionary cam-
paign to be h/1d throughout the dis-
trict. The following were appointed
as members of the Sunday school
execuitye of Oxley and Harrow, re-
spedtively:—Mrs. Eva Clark, O. I.|
Bowring and Leo Cralg, and James |
| Bailey, J. A. Secord and A. L. Mu
gor. The financial budget was laid over |°
owing to the small number of mem-
bers present.

One of our enterprising cltizéns is |
out with a petition to those cencerned
seeking to have the drainage system
on the east side of Queen street, from
| Munger avenue north, improved. The |
drain which is already in Is evidently |
not deep enough and the tile are too |
small to carry off the water, especial |
ly when the snow melts or when there |
is prolonged rain. Those who have |
to pass back and forth along. the ent, |
| side of snid street when the snow 1s |
{melting and when’ large quantities of
water has fallen know what a wretch-
od condition the’ sidewalk in front of}
of the Methodist hr ry has been |
{In, making it almos passible, while |
the adjoining lot is flooded across at
|such times, Other properties north
of thege are also affected less or more.
| A drain similar to what ‘Is being pro:
posed will also be of great benefit |
|to the public highway, which gots
| badly cut up during the wet season,
especially between, Munger avenue
and the railrdnd because the present |
|deain does not sufficiently carry .off
the excess of water. It is. therefore |
to he hoped that thig desirable scheme |
| may soon-be brought into effeat. |
