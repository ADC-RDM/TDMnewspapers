Through the steadily increasing cost of materials and difficulties in gdiveries of goods, through the

'* shortage and enormous cost of labor, embargoes on railways, shortage of coiton crop, and steadily increasing

high prices and demand for same on the mills for. cotton -cloth of. all kinds, 8nd the increasing demand

through the general prosperity of all classes of labor, and the last but most jmportant factor is the UNITED

STATES GOVERNMENT coming into the market for enormous quantities of Cotton, both raw.and manu-
factured.: ;

Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Richardson and
Master Karl, Walkerville, left Wednes-
dny morning to spend about two months
in the Northwest, owing to the {ll
health of Master Karl. During their

foundland, where they spent three
months with Mr. Wright's relatives.

The following recipe for vegetable
marrow, asked for by a subscriber
last week, has been sent.n by L, B.:
“Cut off rind, take out seeds; quarter
it, then put in pot of boiling water
"with tablespoonful of salt. Boll ten
minutes or until tender. To be served
with butter sauce or mashed with
butter, pepper and salt. When it gets
old can bake in oven llke any other
squash."

Wheat threshing {8 now In full
swing, The average: turnout is 30
bushels per ccre, though some claim
to have reached 36 bushels per acre.
The price, $2.10 to $2.25, Is tempting
many to sell at once, The crop ‘at
Marshfield, which wns an excellent
one, has all been housed, and ant’ cut-
ting has commenced. Threshing will
not begin until the rest of the harvest
has been completed.

Mrs. Ross Martin and Mrs. William
White were hostesses at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Richardsin,
Tuesday afternoon, at a miscellane-
ous shower given for Mrs. Carey
Drummond, a recent bride. About
fifty ladies of the community were
present, and the bride was showered
bountifully with silverware and other
handsome gifts. The afternoon was
enjoyably spent and closed with a
bounteous supper.

J. J. Newman, C.E,, has filed his re-
port on the Hughson drain with J. H.
Madill, township clork. He commenao
ed Lis survey of this drain at the Cou-
ter Sideroad drain, 6th concession, and
followed the course of the present
small ditch to the 16 and 17 sideroad.
The north branch was surveyed from
the north townline road and followed
the line between lotq 14 and 16° south
to the main drain, and found that the
area {ga at present very inadequately
drained. Mr. Newman recommends a
drain with branches to cost together
with all incidental expenses $2,180. Of
this amount he has assessed the Jands
benefitted with $2,116, and the town-
ship for roads $26, for bridge $40. A
by-law will be prepared and the work
be undertaken this season.
