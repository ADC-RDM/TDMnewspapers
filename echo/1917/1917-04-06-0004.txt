We are hearing and telling a’ good deal about
ugports designs” this spring, and there is no doubt at all
put that there will be many such designs in hats and
clothes—the iden prevades the: separate skirt, the dress,
the blouse, the middy.

:
:

There is fascination in seeing the materials, plan-

ning the garment, and either making it or having it made. :)
To these we suggest a look through our Wash Goods offer- i
ings, where will be found the heavy cotton materials for x
summer wear, and the light, filmy creations like Khaki 3
Kool, Voile, Crepe, Soisette, ete—with various sized fig- I

ures from minute to pold, and subdued colors to those

which are dashing—also in stripes.

Then see the Butterick book for a pattern; you'll

surely find it there.

Then about Hosiery and Hats.

— The committee of the council met
James Anderson, Manager of the S.,
W. & A. Electric Railway, recently,
with reference to moving the tracks
to the center of Sandwich street. Mr.
Anderson recelved them in a
very: friendly spirit, and agreed to
move the tracks If the council would
lay a 6:dnch concrete foundation on
which to place it. Mr.. Anderson also
suggested that on account of the war
and the condition of the labor market
that this work be undertaken only as
far as North street during the present
year.

One result of the: voluntary ration-
ing system in England has been that
a large number of families in the fash-
fonable quarters of London have: put
thelr servants on board wages, which
means that instead of giving board to
dervants the householder pays them
go much a week and lets them board
themselves The reason for the
change is that the servants refused to
eat the restricted meals served to oth-
ers in the hougehold, Board wages
are now generally twelve or sixteen
shillings a week.
