derous and lying report spread abroad
in Amherstburg during the past Week,
that caused my defeat at the municipa)
elections, to the effect that 1 threaten.
ed proceedings to disqualify Edward
Crimmins, one of the candidates, on
the ground that he was a High school
trustee. This was a falsehood with-
out the shadow of foundation, started
by some one with no other motive
than injuring me in the eyes of the
electors, and as it had too much of a
start before it came to my ears, it
was impossible to refute. it before it
had accomplished its purpose.

The man who basely fastened this
slander on me, and those who retailed
ft around town knowing they were ut-
tering a rank untruth, may. have
guined. their object for the time, but
such underhand means goes far to |
destroy the people's confidence in the
designing persons who framed up the
deal for their own selfish ends. I
thank those who, in spite of having the
| Ilo whispered to them. cast their votes
in my favor.
