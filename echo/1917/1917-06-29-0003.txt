* THE ENERGY FOOD

There is something in oats which ereates
opirit and energy. No other grain canbring
results like them. Everyone knows what
oats do for horses, They bave the same
effect on man.

An extract of oats is employed asa tonic.
A diet of onts multiplies one's vitality,
That's why energetic men—men of vim
and spirit—are said to “feck their oats.”

In Quaker Oats the finest oats—Canadinn
grown—are subjected to 62’ siftings. Just
the rich; plump grains ore used, There i5
only. tetspounds of Quaker Oats in a bushel.

These grains have t aximum of rich.
ness nnd ener T also the most
delicious. To eat Quaker Oats once a day
for h month will show to the limit what
tonic effects, what bubbling vitality one
can get from oatmenl. One never knows
how good oat food is, or what it can do, unr
til he tries Quaker Oats.

Made in Canada.

riotle phases of W. C. T. U. work.
Th follow ng resolutions were adopt
ed: —

1. That we stand, as always, un-
compromisingly opposed to the liquor
trafic and pledge ourselves to work
with all the ability God has given us
for its entire abolition in this our Do-
minfon. a A

2. That being dissatisfied with the
| provisions of the Provincial Act as
regards the importation of ale~holic
liquors: we resolve to ally ourselves.
actively with the present agitation'for
Dominion-wide_ prohibition; ~ also to
work for an amendment which shall
prevent doctors from becoming liquor
vendors, which will force magistrates
to carry out the law, and that will
suppress more efficiently the {llleit
sule of intoxicants.

3. That in view of reliable informa-
tion In possession of the Provincial W.
C. T. U. in regard to vice conditions
existing in soldiers’ camps in Eng-

land, we continué to protest against |

the'wet canteen (which we believe to
be largely responsible for these con-
ditions), as an insult to a country
which, some years ago,’ abdlished the
wet canteen In soldiers’ camps.

4. Resolved, that this convention
appreciates the act of the Legislature
in granting the franchise to women,
andgwe recommend that the W, C. T.
U. women of this county be prepared
to disseminate authoritative infprma-
tion for the benefit of ‘women voters
in our communities, In order that the

omen's first vote under the new dct

may be an Intelligent express on of
their high Ideals of civic and Govern:
mental legislation:
6. That recognizing the need, un-
der the present war conditions, for
the conseryation of all food products,
resolved, that W. C. T. U. women
should do everything in their power to
‘help curtail as far as possible the
consumption of luxuries and costly
foods not high in food value; algo re-
solved, that statistics showing the
enormous wastage of grain annually
used In the manufacture of alcohol;
warrant us in striving for legislation
which shall prohibit the manufacture
of the pame’in our Dominion.

6. That we increase our efforts to
send to the soldiers in the trenches,
good, wholesome, - stimulating food
substituws, such as cocoa, chocolate,
soups, etc, instead of cigarettes and
tobacco, the same tovbe administersd
by our representatives with the Y. M.
C. A. at the front. '-. &

7. ‘That In view: of the fact that
'Liconse Inspectors of this county have
found that ‘the sale of “near beer” or
“prah
ace to the youth of our communities
in establishing the drink habit in chil
drgn, and that it is also keeping In
effect the treating system, we Tecom-
mend that proper steps be taken to
eliminate the sale thereof. 4

The afternoon sossion closed at 6
o'clock and the delegates were provid-
ed with an excellent supper in the

ing to their homes. The thanks of

The Victims of Nervous
Exhaustion.

BR

When worry Is ndded to overwork
men soon become the victims of ner-
vous exhaustion ~— neurasthenin—the
doctor calls it. Some have no reserve
strength fn thelr systems to bear the
strain; others overtax what strength
they have. If you find that you are
nervous and not sure of yourself, that
you sleep badly, and wake up tired and
aching, gour nerves ore out of order,
Other signs are inability to take prop-
er interest In your work; your appe:
tite {s fickle; your bnck feels weak,
and you are greatly depressed in spir-
its. One or more of these signs mean
that you should take prompt steps to
stop mischief bo mourishing the
nerves with the food they thrive on,
namely the rich, red blood made by
Dr. Willinms' Pink Pills. These pjlls
have cured thousands of cases of
nervous disorders, including nervous
prostration, neurelgia, St. Vitus dance
and partinl paralysis. Here is an ex-
ample, P. H., Callan, a well known
business ' man in Coleman, P. E, IL,
says:—*l owe my present health, if
not life itself, to Dr. Willlams' Pink
Pills, 1 had always been an active
man, and when I began to run down
in ‘health paid little attention to it as
I ghought it only a temporary weak-
ness. As time passed, however, I
found myself growing worse, and con-
sulted a doctor, who seid thet 1 was
not only badly run down, but’ that my
nervous system was badly shattered.
I lost flesh, my appetite was poor, I
slept badly and notwithstanding the
doctor's treatment grew so weak that
I had to leave my business and was
confined to the house. Time went on
and I was steadily growing weaker,
and my friends were all greatly alarm-
ed for my condition. “In this condition
I was strongly recommended tos try
Dr. Williams’ Pink, Pills, and as the
doctor's medicine was not helping me
I decided to do so. By the time I had
used three boxes I could tell that they
were helping me., When 1 had taken
eight boxes of the pills I felt able to
attend to my business agnin, and peo-
ple were surprised to see me out. I
continued the use of the pills until 1
had teken twelve boxes, by which time
I was feeling ag well as ever | did,
and was being congratulated by all
my friends on my full restoration to
health. I feel now that if I had used
Dr. Willlams' Pink Pills at the outset
I would not only have saved much
money spent in doctor's bills,” but
would have had reaewed health soon-
er. I cannot speak too highly of this
medicine, and would recommend it to
every man who feels weak, nervous,
or run down.” —

You cen get these pills through any
medicine dealer, or by mall at 50 cents
a box, or six boxes for $2.60 from The
‘Dr. Willlams' Medicine Co., Brock-
ville, Ont.
