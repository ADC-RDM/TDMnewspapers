{sm too. long to be m party to any
such result. In a straight fight It
would haye been a pleasure to have
accopted the nomination”so. generously
tondered me by the Liberals of South
Essex, , which kindnegs I will never
forget. “However, ns Mr. Atkin feels
tliat he cannot withdraw, 1 request that

Dr. Brien was not present, but was
jrepresented by Lewis Wigle and the
Rev. Mr. Carlisle, of Winsor,

Mr. Atkin was the first-speaker, and
{occupied the attenijon ofsthe hall for
a few minutes. He was received with
cheers, and “sald that te was neither
{ashamed nor afraid to facd the clec-
tors of ‘South Essex at all times. He
did not discuss the'winning of the war,
declaring that tho uppermost wish of

AMHERSTBURG, "ONTARIO, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1917

not three yenrs later, when it was
necessary to coax Liberals in to cover
up his dirty record.” The speaker did
not expect much from the present
Cabinet Liberals, ns they were in great
minority. The Cabinet, as formed,
did not appeal to him, as six repre-
sentatives in a Board of nine cannot
be ruled by three. He figured that
N. It. grant, which ho attacked
with considerable vigor, was to be
divided fifty, fifty between the Govern-
ment ‘and the rallrond company. He
also criticised the small amount paid
to soldiers in the trenches. The sol-
dler, he exclaimed, received $1.10 for
fighting in the trenches of France,
while Sir Jtobert Borden received $15,
000 a year digging trenches night
and day to Keep his party in power.
Voluntary recruiting failed by reason
of. the Government mismanagement, but
be dome means devised
to” enable Canada to continue in the
greatost struggle of the world's his-
tory. He could mot be accused of dis-
loyalty, nor of lack of interest In the
war, as he had lost one brother, throe
cousins and several nephews, “Some-
where in France.” Who would make
the best representative, a farmer.or n
doctor? (Yel and counter yells.)
“I'd ganmble\the last dollar 1 have that
{rf the manufacturers were compelled
to cough up the enormous profits they
are making just now, this war would
not last two months,” Lhe declared
dramatically. “Men be men, ‘not
sheep, and vote for your own {inter
ests, and the greatest Canadian states-
man, Sir Wilfrid Lawrier."”

Rev. Mr. Carlisle, of Windsor, at-
tended a nominatiom convention for
thd first time in hits life and came as a
patriot, not as wm politician. *I have
no love fom the 'Profiteer,” said he,
“but as a returned soldier, I appeal for
the bost palid soldiers, most courage-
ous men jm the world, the British
army.” Tle men, he found were al:
ways courmgeous and completely satis-
flad. This election Is not a political
affair, but should call for ithe action
of patriotic men. The answer to the
call for mem, money nndivesources
from the outhireak of the war is most
patriotic. Dr. Brien's absence is due
to his devotion tw duty. He eulogized
him asin ‘physician, as a man, as a
patriot, and-avas liere In his 4nterests
to appenl to actual patriotism.’ The
herolsm of tlhe women in giving up
their sons for overseas services
darned for tlhem the franchise, He
snfd, we ares ‘mace to’ fece with a
three fold crisis, in the most pregnant
time since the dawn of human History.
This war {8 mot waged to satisfy «a
whim of poliitics, to enlarge our bor-
ders or digpliuy our Navy's might, but
ft 18 © war of autocracy ‘against
democracy. There {8 a crisis now in
Imperial affairs; Russia {8 in. the

the time; France: has been bled white
from its noble effforts to repel the in.

the gresiont fighting mmehine in the

to the fact that Enggland is facing a

this war, ar motherland will go down

this a. crisin in hunnan® and national
affairs, it is the greatest erfsis in Can-
adlan affairs, sir thie dawn of Con-
fataration We army in a fair way,
ugless we win this, War, to bow down
ds shves to the wiorst tyrant in the
world's Pisieny. While there was a
Military Service Ait §n force in Can-
ada at the beginniing.of tho war, {it
wil. thought Dest then mot to enforce
ft. Tur leave the Taising of on ‘army
to voluntary service; and four hmndsed
thopsand of the besit and finest men in
the, world came forward: He ‘referred
brick (c ‘the eloquent spo s of
Primer Borden andk Sie Wi Laur
fer when the firsfi- contingen’ vent
oversees, which ingpired the men to
do the almost inifpossible things they?
did, because thiey had the assurance
that Copalia, which they left behind,
was With them to the last ounce of
minhood and last cént. He argued by
colmparing Sir Wilfrid Laurler’s mani
fosito and the manifesto of Sir Robbart
Borden, that Canada would scarcely be
beliind them now If Sir Wilfrid Laur-
ler were followed. The Government
argued that there should be the least
Possible delay Im this national emer-
&aenct. He appealed to them to do the
greatest good they could do, and vote
at this time to kill politics for all time
to come, This Is not politics, It is not
porsonndities; {tds patristism, and they
should be ready and willing to hold up

tho old flag. (

JRobert Atkin wound up the meet-
ing. The Government of the country,
fie sald, has no right to be taken too
for from tho people. The people had
the right to pronounce on all such im
bortant question ns conscription, and
ho wos: with Sir Wilfrid Baurier in
demanding that the people have their
Say on this matter. No Government,
Ip matter ow able or intellectual it
ly, can bo bigger than its leader, and
lio asked If at present, in all fairness,
Nir Robert Borden, the leader of the
Government, had shown hintbelt equal
to the emergenty. Ho was Indeed
