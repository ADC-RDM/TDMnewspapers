of Refuge.

To the Warden and Members of Essex County Council, in Council assembled:
Gentlemen —We, your Standing Committee of the House of Refuge and
Industrial Farm, beg leave to report for the first half year of 1917 as follows:

During this time we have had five meetings for the transaction of busi:

ness. In regard to the farm, everything Is looking very good considering the

condition of the season.
We find that in the construction of a drain. on the west side of the farm

‘the ferice had to be removed, and we have instructed the Keeper to have a

new one erected in place of the old fence, as it 18 not worth re-stretching.
We also recommend that the farm be tile drained as soon as finances

will allow.
We have continued with the repairing and painting of the House, which

I are ‘about completed, and will give the House a decidedly improved appear-
