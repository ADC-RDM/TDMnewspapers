He says that practical tie only

  
 

change,in the rogulatic will be that
embodying the limitation of sectoin 2,
for A temporary stay.” In other
words, all aliens; whether @anadians
or not, otherwise admissable when en-
ter the United, States with intent to
remain = permanently In the United
5 must pay the $8 tox, but neither
“aliens” (including Canadians) who
enter the United States after an’ un-
Interrupted residence of at Jeast one
vear immediately preceding such en-
trance. in the Dominion of Cuanade for
a temporary stay, nor “aliens in
transit through the United States” will
be called upon to pey the’ tax,

« “How ti i= Interpreted.

In answer to inquiries as to how the
department would interpret the phrase
"for a temporary stay” and the pifrase
“aliens in transit*through the United
States,” the United States Immigra-
flon Commissioner “fiated that “in
transit” would be held to mean a stay
of one or two days nt the United
States port of entry, and temporary
stay would be interpreted to mean
a more lengthy stay within the U,"S.,
a5 4 month or two or even longer.
The importance of the distinction lies
fn the fact that persons who have
been resident in Canada for one year
or more may make a “temporary stay”
within the United States, whereas
those who have resided in Canada for
less than one year will be limited to
the “in transit” privileges.

United States officials state that
the law will be liberally interpreted in
50 far as it affects travel from Canada,
and that the regulations, which take
effect on May. 1st, will conform to the
present practice as far .as consistent
with the provisions of the new law.

“Joker”

-— .

A despatch from Ottawa deals fully
with the proposed U, S. immigration
regulations, which so vitally cffect
persons lving along the border, It
says: —"In the new United States
Immigration regulations which go into
effect on May first, hes been discover-
ed a ‘joker” which will, if it {8 not re-
moved, occasion much annoyance to
Canadians visiting the United States,
.Under the present immigration law of
the Republic, citizens of Caned?, Cuba
and Mexico are specially exempted
from the head tax and similar restric-
tions, but the new rule nullifies this
exemption.

“Under the regulation In effect af-
ter April, Canadians who wish to lo
cate in the United States will have to
pay the head tax of elght dollars, Can-
adians visiting the United States for
a longer peridbd than sixty days will
have to pay a similar tax and those
who wish to visit that country for less
than sixty days will have to deposit
eight dallars to be refunded If they
roturn before the:lapse of two months.
The act will ‘even penalize Canadions
living In the United States who have
not become citizens. If they revisit
thelr old home, on returning to their
place of business the head tax must
be imposed.

It was only recently that this fea-
ture of the new act was discovered
and the discovery has caused conster
nation among the transportation ¢om-
panies. ‘A prominent transportation
man has been to Washington and the
officials there were astounded at the
Interpretation placed on the regula-
tions although they admitted that the
Interpretation swas correct, The mat-
ter has been brought before the Can-
adian Government and representations
will be made to Washington at once
to secure exemption far Canadians
from the obnoxious regluations.

"A special session of Congress has
been called for April 21d to deal. with
the war situation. It is very probable
that an amendment will be made fo
the United States Immigration Act at
the coming session. This would bein
ample time as the mew Act goes {nto
effect in May.

troduced in the Legislature on Friday
a bill intended to make possible the
‘registration of women, following the
extension of the franchise to them
The bill also will provide for the
registration of soldiers and others left
off the lists. Government measures
dealing with the solicitation of lquor

eral satisfaction with the operation of

Increase in Nickel Taxes.

A great-Increase in the revenue of
the Province which should “end to
relieve somewhat the pressure of other
Lixation, comes as a direct result of
the campaign carried on by the Liber-
als in the Legislature since 1915 for
heavier taxation of the International
Nickel Company Mr. Rowell, “Mr,
Carter and Mr, 'Dewart, with other
members, have been fighting for this
change and nowsit is coming. It is
roughtly estimated that under the new
system of taxation, if the’ Act follows
the bugis of the Commission's report,
the International Nickel Company will
have to pay the. Province this year
nearly a million. dollars in taxation,
instead of the paltry $40,000 a year
which they have been paying and
which the Government was allowing
them to pay until the Opposition forced
the issue. po :

The new Government bill affects not
only nickel mines, but all mining con-
cerns. whose annual profits exceed
$10,000. The tax is raised from 3 to
5 per cent, with a sliding scale dof.
per cent. additional Lor every five mil-
lion: dollars extra annual profits.

Edugational Fads.

| Fads in the educational systeni in-
terfering with the children of the Pro-
vince securing an adequate training In
fundamental subjects, were discussed
by Wm. McDonald, Liberal member
for, North :Broce, ~ He turned his at-
tention particulerly to the regulations
and examination papers in art. One of
the questions which Jind been required
of the pupils was “Praw?and paint the
wildigdrrot in flower.” “\Why not have.
the children,” ashe Mr. MacDonald,
“taught to pull them out?” “A more
practical, ‘question, he suggested,
ploture of the
Attorney-Gendral with his" ear to the
ground.” “Another example of a ques-

 

 

 

  

 

 
  

  

tion asked« was: “Draw the naisy
geese that gabbled o'er the pool”
“What goose,” ‘demanded’ Mr. ~Mac-

Donald, “put that on the paper?” ‘And
then heturned to the Ministey of Edu.
catlon and said, “Why not” clip the
wings of thesé jackasses who put such
questions on ‘the papers?”

“You mean the earsy’ called out Sam

 

 

‘Carter, and averybody laughed, “The

teaching of sueh stuff,” concluded Mr.
MacDonald, “is good for neither this
world or the next.”

~ On the same evening Mr. MacDonald
scored another hit with reference to
Government House. The Government
Is cutting off a’ grant of $500 which
It<has given for several years to a
country road in North Bruce. “Four-
teen hundred dollars,” hie said, “for a
Lonegal ‘rug for Government House
and not a cent for the farmers of Mal-
abel; seven hundf@d” dollars for a
commode’ for Government House and
not a cent for the farmers of Malabel;
$445 for curtains for the ballroom of
Government House and not a cent for
the farmers of Malabel.” And so he
went on, contrasting item. after item
of the treatment accorded to Govern.
ment House and to the farmers of
Bruce.

LOANS TO FORMERS.

     
    

 

The Ontario Government's proposils
to assist the farmers of the Province
through the municipalities by making
loans upon farm [mprovements at a
low rate of Interest occuplea the at-
tention of the Legislature on Tuesday.
The Government's plan, stated Hon.
I. B. Lucas, was to follow the system
used in respect to loans made on
drainnge by-laws, Any township coun-
col that desired to make loans to a
farmer would be required to pass a
general by-law. Then when a farmer
needed a loan he applied to the coun-
cil, which passed it. after making in-
quiries as to the farmer's standing
and the uses to which the money was
to be devoted. The application would
then be forwarded to the Provincial
Treasurer and in due course a check
forwarded to the council and then to
the applicant. :

The Attorney-General polntell ont
that the Government did not intend
that loans should be made on improve-
ments to be built, but rather on those
already in existence. He pointed out
that a farmer haying had his appli-
cation endorsed could easily get local
banking accommodation to make per-
manent improvements and pay off lis
temporary loan when the work was
finished and his loan fro mthe Gov-
ernment Treasury was avallable.

LP. Wigle, Soutli Essex, BURRESS
that the municipal councils be per-
mjtted. to make advances while the
work was under way, Hon. Mr, Lucas
approved of ‘the suggestion and will
probably frame a clause to cover ft.

The only important amendment to
the Act was moved by Mr. Lucas. It
opens the way for the Government to
provide by regulation fof the loaning
o fmoney to farmers for other than
“permanent improvenfents.” The sug.
gestion was that up to one-half of
the loan the farmer might use ft for
retiring existing™mortgages,

Theloans ‘will probably be made on
a 30-year period at five'per cent., with
very small annucl repayments - of
principal,

«Cut in Number.

 

WHI there be a reduction in the
number, of License Commissiopers?
When seen by (he Star, Chairman J.
D. Flavelle practically intimated that
lle would be = ied with a board of
three commissioners. As- at present
constituted there are five commis-
sloners, although: Fred. Dane, as Loan
Commissioner, does not draw a salary
as a license commissioner,

Air. _Flavelle was asked if the com-
missioners: had. as much work to do
as they had before prohibition went
into force.

“We have a great deal more home-
work to do,” replied the chairman,
“beéause . there are soy many com-
plaints being made, and matters that
need to be cledred up. However, we
had a five-monghs' itinerary _before
prohibition, and we are In.the office
here practically altogether now, The
commissioners formerly had to visit
each; county and city once a year.”

In reply-to no question as to the na-~
ture of the duties of the varjous com-
missioners, Mr. Flavelle stated that

  
  

  

 

which

work

he = tssigned to them.
Ayearst, however, on
agcount of his previous experience,
has, to a large extent, the supervision;
of the law enforcement branch.

“Don't “you think you could got
alang with two ‘epmmissioners now?”
inquired the Star.

“I think it'svould be a ‘calamity’ if
we did not have at least three,” re-
1 4the Chairman. “Supposing
Were omy two commissioners,

them. The pri could not be: car:

and Commissioner John A. Ayearst
$4,000.

Although the license Inspectors
live been reduced. in number from
102 before prohibition to 62 at the
present time, the total “salary list
prictically amounts to that of the.
pre-prohibition days. Every inspec
tor hus to now .devote his full time to
the work, whereas he did not before
that. Consequently the salaries which
formerly ranged from $400 to $600 a

TERILIZING TOBACCO SEED BEDS
[1 D. D. Digges, Supt. Harrow Station

 

SPRING IMPURITIES
IN THE BLOOD

 

   

The increasing prevalence of tobac-
co bed diseases, In the tobacco grow-
ing districts of Westers Ontario, em-
phnsizes more and mdre strongly the
necessity of sterilizing the tobacco
beds in some way, In order that the
grower may produce good . healthy
seedlings for transplanting.

At present there are two recognized
methods of Sterilizing, namely: with
steam and with formalin, Tn either
case, before sterilizing, the beds
should be worked up until the soll |g
in a loose and thoroughly pulverizeq
condition; in order to allow the steam
or formaalin to pass freely through
the soil.

In sterllizing with steam a galvap-
ized iron pan i8 Inverted over the seed
bed and steam Is turned into the pan
from o boiler at a pressure from 100
to 150 pounds for thirty minutes,

The beds should be steamed as early
as possible inthe spring to allow the
soll to reach a normal condition again
before seeding.

The formalin treztment consists of
sprinkling the beds with a solution of
one part of formalin to fifty parts of
water at the rate of one-half gillon of
the solution per square foot of bed.

5 ¢ :8 are most persistent be- | This should be put on in two applica-
apr ea Hien Blood. and it {s:tions twenty-four hours apart, After
at this time when all .nature takes |each application the beds should be

lously needs attention. Some péople i four hours to keep the formalin fumes
dose themselves with purgatives at bin. About twenty-four hours after the
these only further second application the beds shold be

ficently dry they should be loosened up
again to allow the fumes of the forma-
lin to es: apa.

The beds should not be deedéd for
almost a week after this treatment or [3
until’ all’ fumes of the formalin have y
disappeared, '

While both of the above named
methods are efficlent in controlling
plant bed disezses, and the use of one
of the two cannot be too strongly re-
commended, sterilizing with steam has
some advantages over the formalin
treatment. When steam is uged not
only are ihe diseases eliminated but
all weeds are killed also, and the soll
is left"in a somewhat better physical
condition. y

At the Harrow, Tobacco Station we
have generally found sterilizing with
steam to be the most satisfactory
method: :
