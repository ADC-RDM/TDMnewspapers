The Chatham city council recently
passed a. bylaw providing that all
fowl sold on the local market must be
weighed, and a tag attached bearing
the weight and the name of the seller.
Women who come to the market say
that they will not observe the new
regulation, and will ship their fowl
away. It believed the difference
can be smoothed over, and that women
will see that they have beén losing
money on some of their stuff.

LEGISLATIVE NOTES.

TW Seca rry, Provincial Treas-| ©
urer, informed Charles M. Bowman, in|
the Legislature on Friday, that the |
machine gune acquired at an expendi:
ture of $500,000 by the province from
the Savage Arms Company of Utica,
N. Y., and sent overseas, had not been
inspected on behalf of the Ontario |
Government, but an inspection had
been made on behalf of the Dominion
Government, through which the money
contributed by the pravince had gone.
The Inspecting officer was Capt. J. H.
Holliday, who was assisted’ by other
capable and experienced - inspectors.
AH guns were Inspected before leav-
ing the factory at Utica.

Thanks to the twice repeated sug-
gestion of Mr. Rowell, Ontario nurses
serving overseas will be put on the
voters’ list here and thus be entitled
to vate at the next general election as
well as the soldiers.

An Interesting debate took place on
good roads, particularly on the Gov:
ernment’s scheme.for a highway be-
tween Windsor and Montreal. No de-
finite estimates of the cost were given.

The Teachers’ Superannuation
scheme was given a preliminary con-
sideration.

The Provincial Treasurer has a bill
to amend the Tile Drainage Act to
increase the amount which can be
loaned to any one municipality from
$500 to $1000 and the total which may
be loaned under the Act from $500,000
to a million dollars.

Mr. Rowell proposes a select com-
mittee to report and take action in
regard to.a provincial celebration of
Confederation.

NO EAVESDROPPING
ON 'PHONE LINES

 

Among other things, an amendment
to the Ontario Telephone Act provides
a fine of $25 for anyone who repeats
a conversation over the 'phone be-
tween any other parties, except when
lawfully authorized to do so.

A similar fine may be imposed on
any employee of a telephone com-
pany who repéats anything that-has
gone over the line. One reason for
this “provision was the case where
two daughters of a ceottle buyer were
working In exchanges, and would tell
thelr father the price other buyers
were offering.

Another commendable amendment
is that one which requires an annual
meeting to be held by every telephone
system, whether controlled by the
council or a commission, and also re-
quires a report of the system to be
prepared for the subgeribers.

The amended law also provides
that every szle of one telephone com:
pany to another must be approved by
the Ontario Railway and Municipal
Board. This i8 to keep a better
check on transfers and to prevent
monopolistic control, ete.

METHODS SUGGESTED
FOR UTILIZING VACANT
GROUND FOR GARDENS

 

Experimental Farms Note.

From the experience gained in sev-
eral Canadian cities and towns during
the past few years in utilizing vacant
lots for garden purposes, the following
methods are suggested for those who
have not-yet undertaken this work.

1. An organization should be form:
ad, on the executive committee of
which are, at least, two men or wo-
men, who are enthusiastic and willing
to devote some time to looking after
the preparation of the land and the
leying out of plots

Owners of vacant land should be
i ted to offer such property for gar-
den mekingy

3. Assuming that a fairly lcrge
number of lots have been, offered by
their owners, it should be widely ad-
vertised that one of these is available
to any citizen who will be willing to
work It,. experience having shown that
all classes in the community are in-

4, It hos been learned by exper-|munication between Dominion, and
jence that it is important for the or- Provincial companies, or, in other

words, between the Bell Company and
all independent ones. A similar act
is sprepored to the Dominion. Parlia-
ment, and If passed, will provide for
a Joint ‘Board, representing the Do-
minion‘and Provincial Railway Boards,
to puss upon applications for inter-

ganization to, atleast, plough and
harrow the land for the plot holders
the first year, Few persons who have
not done any gardening before can be
induced to prepare lund for seed sow-
ing on thefr own initiative.

5. ‘There are four methods by which
funds may be raised to prepare the
Jand, r

(a) By an appeal to wealthy citi:
zens for contributions. {

(b)" By a grant from the city or
town council if necessary, on the un-
derstanding that the money will be
returned by the plat holders when
they have harvested their first crop.

(¢c) The city or town council might
appoint a committee to carry out
such work, the ajty to aid In every
possible way. In order that a move-
ment of this kind may have at least
the greater sympathy of the civic of-
ficlals, It would seem desirable for the
organization to have. a” room in the
city or town hall for Its meeting.

(d) BygeeNarglng each plot holder a
small amount, for prepaging the plot
for him.

The last method {8 the one which is
likely to be the most satisfactory for
most ‘cities and towns and Js the one
recommended here.

or by-laws the reader is referred to
the accounts of the! work of the sey-
eral organizations in Canada referred

will, no doubt, be found sufficient kug-
gestions to enable by-jaws to be drawn

Boy Scouts Can Help.

Boy Scouts can be made very useful
In encouraging garden making and the
use of vacant Jots. In Ottawa they
were employed in 1915 by the Public

Alter several years of concrete dis-
cussion the pension scheme of the Dre-
partment of Education has reached the
Legislature. “The bringing down of
the bill means,” says the Mail and
Empire, “that the determined fight
against the meesure by a section of
the teaching profession has failed,
and that the Government, while it has
not the unanimous backing of the
teachers, has taken the stand that the
legislation is in the interest of educa-
tion in Ontario.”

The bill as introduced Is practically
the draft drawn up Over a year ago
und submitted to the teachers of the
Province for an expression of opinion.
It differs, however, from the original
draft in the fact thatépayments to the
pension fund are made only by the
Government and teachers, the school
trustees being relieved from payment,

The-bill permits superannuation at
the end of 15 years and 30 years upon
an actuarial basis. This was inserted
to meat the objections of those who
objected to working 40 years In order
t0' earn a pension. In addition the
bill providés that teachers who retire

the money paid in, but the privilege {8
conditional upon the actuarial poaf-
tion of the fund being satisfactory.
Hon. Dr. Pyne stated that the mini-
mum pension would be $366 a year
and the maximum $1,000, The Min-
ister declured that the legislation
wonld make the profession nore perm-
anent. It would alse have the effect
of bringing back to thé-teaching por-
fesslon a larger number of men.
