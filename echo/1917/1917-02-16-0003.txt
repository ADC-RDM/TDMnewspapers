Oats contain more organic phosphors
than any other grain, and phosphorus is the
brain's main constituent. They contain
more lecithin, and lecithin is the chief
component of the entire nervous system.

That's why workers love oatmeal. That's
why growlpg children crave it. Itissimply

DWARF HEGAR! KAFFIR.

A Sorghum Introduced Into This Cound.
try. From the Sudan,

The agranomy department of 1he Ok
inhoma Agricultural college receives
many Inquiries as to Dwarf Hegarl
Kaffir. A. Danne of the department
of agronomy , says the following in-
formation, taken from a government
report, is an exeellent trentment of (he
subject; !

Dyarf Hegatl §s 8 sorghum that was
Introduced foto the United States from
the Sudan region of Africa fn 1908. . It
I8 nitive fn the same part of Sudan as
feterita and {8 known there by the na
tives ns Hegarl. A. dwarf strain was
obtained by ‘selection’ at the Chill
cothe (Tex.) deld station. nnd this selee
tion was given the name of Dwarf
Hegarl In order-to distinguish It from
Dwarf Black Hulled Koftir. which It
resembles very. closely. The leaves are
numerous and large, lke those of
Kafr. The stem Is not yo thick. bat
Is more Juicy nl sweeter than the
stem of Kafllr, and It bears a uniform,
ly upright seed head very like that of
Kafr in shape, but looser. The seed
Is™a trifle larger than black hull Raff
seed, Dut intermediate between it and
foterita seed tn size and also in hard
ness. Dwarf Hegari under ordinary
conditions grows to a height of four
to four and one-half feet and matures
in ninety to a hundred days, a little
earlier than the dwarf milo, It with
stands drought as well as the latte
and produces an equal yleld of grain
fts short growing seasdn allows ito
be grown well north In the Great
plains, and in the southern part of
this region it produces two crops of
grain In ope season When late rains are
abundant. It is adapted to Texas and
Nety Mexico, western Oklnhoma, Kan-
sns and Nebraska and eastern Colo
rade, «The fodder yield is not eqoal to
that of black hull Kaffir, but is bet-
ter than that of dwarf milo.

 

Rate of Seeding Wheat.

Experiments condncted by the Ohio
experiment station. during seventeen
years and Including c¢ight different
rates of gecding withaten varieties of
whent show that eight pecks td” the
acre give the greatest ‘Het yield of
grain. Figures given in the station's
mouthly ‘bulletin for August point in
general to a gradual dncrease in yleld
from the use of three pecks to nine
pecks per acre, but scading more than
eight pecks to the acre has not paid
for the extra seed.

Useful Device on Tracie,

It is stated that this device automat.
Ically steers a tractor and keeps fits
