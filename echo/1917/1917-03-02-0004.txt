The soldier-settlement bill was given
{ts first reading in the Provincial Leg-
islature Monday. The Minister in
charge of the bill told of the scheme
to establish communities for soldiers.
Buildings would be erected and the

. land cleared. Each location: would in-
! clude $0 acres and ten acres along the

front of each location would be clear-
ed. When a soldler-settler wanted
one of these it would be supplied to
him free of cost. The central depot
would maintain machinery and equip-
ment for stumping, seeding, mowing,
ete., and they would be at his service
at a nominal amount. Such equipment
as he needed for his private use would
be secured out of funds advanced un-
der the Loans Act if necessary.” The
Minister stated that a start would
shortly be made at Monteith, and that
there were more applications. from
ex-goldiers than ‘could be handled at

another pigeon put in an ‘appearance,
