CO-OPERATIVE WOOL BUYING.

  
 
 

 

   

 

  

   

 

 

Quite a large number of sheep rais-
ers in South Essex have agreed to dis-
poee of their wool on a co-operative
basis, having it graded at Guelph, In
accordance with the recommendation
made by the Ontario Sheep Breeders
Association some time agg, Breeders
from Anderdon, JMaldén, - Colchester
South, Gosfleld South, Mergen, Gosfleld
North, Maidstone, and many other
places are included in thé list, the last,
names being dent in on April 30th.

“The new plan, those connected with
the industry say. willbe of great bene-
fit to the manufacturer, os he will now
be able to buy the grade of wool which
he requires, and will not. he put to the
expense of grading it himself. Under
the old system, wool from all parte of
the country was bought and often
much of it proved of no use to the pur-
chaser as it was inferior or superior
to the grade which he required.

The association makes a charge of
five cents a fleech to cover insurance
on’ the’ wool, cost of twine and sacks,
cartage at Guelph and the labor in-
wolved in handling the . wool The
grading is done free of charge by of-
ficfals of the Dominion Live Stock
branch. The clerical work, printing,
postage and stationery costs are pald
by the Ontario Departmgnt of Agricul-
ture.

All the provinces Have been selling
wool co-operztively for a number of
years, generally charging $1 member
ship fee, and 1c, a pound for handling
the wool. The shipper paid the freight
to the grading depot. ‘The system {o
be used here will cost, considerably
less. The highest freight rate for 100
pounds, less than caglots, is from Fort
William. The circular. sent to the
growers by the association glates that
it 18 $1.05. The charge per 100 pounds
in jcar lots from the same place, the
circular states, is 86c.

The sheep raisers re urged to have
their shearing completed in time to
haye the wool at the Winter Fair bulld-
ing, Guelph, between, May 15th and
June 11th. The wool will not be tub-
washed, but shipped jn its natural
grense condition, with the freight pre-
paid. Aftér grading it will be sold by
tender or otherwise through the med-
jum of the association as early as pos-
sible. It 1s expected that grading will
be commenced by June 18th.

“USE OF SMALL: SEED

“4 the Seed js Sound.
Speaking at Guelph, Prof. Zavitz

said, the average Wield of potatoes per
acre in Ontario In 1916 was 53 bushels,
The ‘next Jowest yield in the last
thirty-five years was 76 and the aver-
age annual yield for the whole period,
114 bushels per acre. Considering both
yields and prices of seventeen differ-
ent farm crops those which ‘gave the
greatest returns per acre in Ontario
in 1816 were as follows: Potatoes,
$78; turnips and other field roots,-$76;
beans, $63; husking corn, $39, and fall
wheat, $33. It will be seen that the
highest returns were obtained from
the cultivated crops.

According to present prices the food
value of rice purchaséd for one dollar
is” equal to that of potatods costing
two dollars. Rice can be used as a
vegetable to take the place of pota-
toes, Seed potatoes are exceedingly
scarce and people throughout the pro-
vince aro eating potatoes which should
be retained for planting. Those far:
mers are wise who retained thelr po-
tato crop for seed purposes even
though they are criticized for not
bringing’ them to market. 1 would
suggest that those having seed pota-
toes for sale, beyond local require-
ments, advertise in local, agricultural
or daily papers.

In normal years it js economy to,

cut good sized potatoes in sets vary-
ing from one ounce to two ounces each,
In the average of ten tests conducted
at Guelph in five years the following
average annual yields per acre were
obtained from good sized potatoes cut
into_pleces of different weights as
here indicated: two ounces, 150 bush-
els; one ounce, 130 bushels; one-half
ounce, 109 bushels; one-quarter ounce,
98 bushels; one-eighth ounce, 79 bush-
cle, and one-sixteenth ounce, 37 bush-
‘els. Small potatoes are frequently
produced from scrubs or from diseased
tubers. , >

. The usual time for planting pota-
toes for best results is from the 16th
to the 26th of May. Potntoes do well

The worms are especially, prevalent
on sod land. They generally feed only
at night, cutting off plants near the
ground and sometimes burrowing into
the plant itself. Ohio entomologists
recommend poisoned bran bait for use
in badly infested fields to kill off these
insects. The directions given for the
mixture are: With 256 to 36 pounds of
wheat bran, or a greater amount of
cornmeal or maddlings, thoroughly
mix while dry one-helf pound of Paris

arsenate of lead, or of powdered white
arsenic, Dilute one quart of ‘any
cheap syrup with two or three gallons
of water and mix with the bran and
arsenic. Run through a meat grinder
six lemons or oranges or else chop
them fine and add the skins, pulp and
Juice to the other Ingredients. Add
sufficient water to wet the mixture,
not making it sloppy: b

drains only wet ground could be seen.
These same flelds are now looming up
high and dry, and the crops which
have been planted in them are com-
ing along all in a good healthy condl-
tion. Many of the growers here are
declaring that this will be the record
year for the hay and clover crop, They
also say the root crop will be the
heaviest seen here for many years.
Many tons of fertilizers have been put
on’ the fields.—Cherry trees are look-
ing at their best,and a few warm days
will bring them all out in full blossom.
Berry bushes, both black "and red
raspberry, are now out in leaf, and the
buds all show indications of a heavy
crop. Early tomato plants never loook-
ed better, and about the middle of this
month will see thousands set out in:the
large ‘fields all® in the pink of’ condi

now growing by leaps and bounds, and
growers are all plensed with the good
outlook for everything.
