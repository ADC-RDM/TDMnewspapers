REVIEW OF SESSION

In Provincial House.

Not for. yenrs has so much work
been done by the Legislature in a
seven weeks’ perlod as was accom:
plished in the session recently brought
to~a close There were also more
night sessions than usual and, taken
generally, the members stuck closely
to business. Both Government and
Opposition seem well pleased with the
results. The former say they are glad
to see Woman Suffrage on the statute
books and they point to the greatly
increased taxatoin of the nickel com-
panies and the general buoyant condi-
dition of the province's finances. The
Opposition, on the others hand, claims
that the principal measures of the
year were Liberal policies and that
the province more and more Is being
governed by the Opposition. The laws
are theirs include Women's Franchise,
Increased nickel taxation, First Ald in
Workmen's Compensation, Loans for
agricultural purposes and control by
muncipalities of the production as well
as the distribution of electrical power
under the Hydroisystem.

Agricultural re-organization was ef-
fected by a Government act which
the Government claims will increase
the efficiency of the Department by
providing more officials to take care of
the work. The Opposition strenuously
opposed the Government plan, con-
tending that the multiplication of of-
fices would lead to ineffectiveness and
claiming that what should be done was
the appointment of one outstanding
man as Minister 6f Agriculture and
another as Deputy, without the com-
plicated system at present of a
Minister, two or more Deputy Min-
{sters, a Commissioner and an Assist-
ant Commissioner, hardly any of whom
are able to give their whole time to
the work.

INCREASE WHEAT YIELDS
\ BY SPRING FERTILIZERS

With wheat soaring towards the
| highest prizes in history, farmers may
afford to spend some extra effort In
increasing the yields of this crop, es-
peeinlly since: Inst winter was unusu-
ally hard on wheat. CropPspecialists
at the Ohio Experiment Station say a
Jittle timely fertilization on wheat
fields in April may result in marked,
profitable increases in yields.
Wheatflelds not fertilized last fall
nor manured during the winter may be
treated with 200 pounds of acid phos-
phate and 60 pounds of nitrate of soda
per acre. If fertilizers or manure Was
applied previously, just a light appli
cition of nitrate of soda is advised.
these fertilizers may be sown by hand
after being finely pulverized, and are
best used just as growth starts i
April, according to the experiment
station officials.

Rut All Danger of Frosts Should Be
Passed Before Tender Crops Are
Put in the Ground.

§. C. JOHNSTON, Vegetable

Specialist, Ontario Department of
Agriculture, Toronto.)

Some of our vegetables are very

tender and should not be planted
until after all danger of frost is over,
It must be remembered that becaund
the soll is ready to receive the planls
it 18 not absolutely necessary that
the grower should set the plants ott. -
Potatoes planted out between 24th 10
May and even the first of June will 11
give excellent results, Tomatos miY
be get out after the 6th of June and
good returns expected, as some sei”
sons a severe frost destroys many
tomato plants as late’ as June 6th.
Vine crops such as cucumber and
squash may be planted after all dan-
ger of frost is over.

POTATOES. Potatoes are one
crop which may be planted on land
which {8 considered to be in a very
rough condition. Possibly there is
no better crop to be planted on land
which has been in sod for a number
of years. Medium-sized tubers of
good quality should be secured and
they shonld be cut so that there are
at least two eyes in each piece or set
It is a good plan in a small garden
to have the soil prepared fairly well,
then cut the seed and commencs
planting. Furrows may be made with
the hoe about six inches deep und
two feet apart. The sets mmy be
placed twelve Inches apart: in the
bottom of the furrow and should be
covered with two inches of sail. This
will -leave the young plasut more or
Jess in a trench, As the , plants
grow the soll will be gradually drag-
ed up and the trench ‘will be filled.
It will be necessary tm cultivate the
soil between the rows 80 as to keep
down weeds, and at the same time
sofl should be graduallly drawn up to
the tops in sufficlenrt quantities So
that the growing roots will not be
exposed to the sumlight, which will
cause them to turm green and be of
inferior quality. 1If an early variety
has been rplantéd and a vigorous
growth has resulited it is possoble
that some may bs fit to dig in August.
By removing same of the soil from
around a hill wiith the hand one can
tell whether they are fit to dig. If
the potatoes are grown for winter
use they do not meed to be dug until
quite late in the fall. The tops will
die down at the: first frost, but it Is
not absolutely necessary that they be
dug immediately. They should, how-
ever, be-dug before. there Js any
severe frost. J

any other crop in the garden, and the
sail between the rows should be
stirred constantly. In the ffall when
the celery has reached, sufMcient
height it will be found necessary to
blanch it. Possibly the best me-
thod being to stand twelve inch
boards against the rows of plants,
holding them in position with stakes
at each end. In from ten days to
two weeks the celery plants will have
grown considerably, and owing to
the exclusion of the light will have
become fairly well whitened, which
{fmproves the guality. The celery
plants should be used as BOON as pos-
gible after bleachib: Othef Methodd
of bleaching celery are the drawing
of earth up around the plant grad-
ually, commencing when the head of
the plants are ahout four inches
above the ground. Brown paper is
sometimes tied around each indi-
vidual head.
