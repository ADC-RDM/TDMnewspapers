HOSTESS

She Entertained a (reat
Man Unawares

  
  

By F. A. MITCHEL

“Gladys,” sald Jobn Oldershaw to
hls daughter before setting out from
the family residence in the province of
ontario, Canada, “General Herbert is
¢oming to see me this morning by ap-
polntment to talk over military mat-
ters pertaining to our Canadian part
in the great war. I have been sum-
moned to another conference of equal
importince. I must rely upon you to
keep the general engaged until my
return; We have important matters
to talk over, and I don’t wish him to
leave without our having the con-

ference.”

“What kind of matters?”

“Herber# has been fighting in Bel-
glum and has greatly. distinguished
himself. 1 need the information he is
able to impart. While recovering from
a wound be has been sent over here
to instruct us in the needs and neces-
gitles of the Canadian troops at tho
front.”

“How Jong will you be gone, papa?”

“It may be an hour; it may be all
day.”

“Well, papa, I'll do what I can with
bim, but I don't sce how I, a mere
gir), can entertain a general.”

The last few words were not heard
by the fasther, who was hurrying away
to catch. a train. -

Gladys Oldershaw proceeded to ex-
ecute «certain household duties which
devolved upon her as her father's
houselseeper. They were not onerous,
and diid not take up much of her time.
When she had finished them ghe went
out om to the porch and looked about
her for some out of door occupation or
amusement. The croquet ground look-
ed inviting, and, taking out a box of
balls amd a mallet, she went there and
began to play alone. But she found
playing croquet without an opponent a
very ‘unsatisfactory amusement, and
was mbout to give it up when, looking
asidie, she saw a small, slender young
man whose clothes fitted him badly
looking over the fence at ber.

“Beg pardon,” he said. “Is this Mr:
Oldershaw's place?”

“It 18.”

“Is be at home?”

“No, he has gone to the city.”

The young man looked disappointed.
He asked how long Mr. Oldershaw
would remain away.

“Father expects a man to sce him
today, a general who has come back
from the war. - Father told me before
going to tell this man that he might
be gone an hour and he might be gone
all day.”

A curious expression passed over the
stranger's face at the mention of the
great man who was expected.

“I don't know,” be said, “that Mr.
Oldershaw will have any-time to devote
to me, haying the general with him.”

Gladys made no reply to this; sho
evidently thought the man was quite
right.

“What is your idea of a general's
age? he asked.

Gladys considered the question irre-
levant but concluded to answer it. She
said a general must be an old man;
forty at Teast. 3

“I think I'll wait awhile,” said the
little man, Jooking interestedly at the
nearby tennis court.

“You might put in some time at ten-
nis,” suggested Gladys; “that is, if you
play the game.”

“One “can't very. well play tennis
without an opponent,” was the reply.

Gladys told himy that she was disen-
gaged and would accommodate him.
She procured a racket for him, and,
climbing the fence, he took position for
the game. He appeared to be an ex-
pert player, but was at a disadvantage
in getting over the ground, dragging
one leg after him with some slight dif-
ficulty. \

They played several sets, and durin,
the time occupled in doing so Gladys’
opinion of her opponent was being im-
proved. He seemed to bo rather gentle
for a man, but amiable as well, and’ ho
was quite original Ip his way of say-
ing things.

The game was interrupted by the ap-
proach of a very large man with gray
moustachios, in uniform, who stopped
and asked if Mr, Oldershaw was at
home: 3

“Are you General Herbert?” asked
Gladys. 4 Ey

“No, I am Colonel Waterman.”

“Papa expects ‘General Herbert to-
day. I supposed you wero he.”

The colonel passed on, and Gladys
turned again to her opponent in tennis
and suggested that he might be tired
and would like to go the house and
rest, Heo admitted that it wap rather

tiresome playing with a game leg, as.

he called it, and he wouldn't mind a
rest. Indeed, he seemed to be quite ex-

bausted with the efforts he had made. |
Gladys led him to the porch, pointed to |

a swinging sofa, and when he sat down
on it insisted that he le at full length
and covered him with an afghan,
“1 think you,
5 15 an active game,” was
reply. GAs Bie 2 LEN

too long,” she

“What made you think that man who
asked if your father was at home was
General Herbert?” ho asked.

“Oh, he was so big and fierco look-
Ing. Then, too, he was about the right
age for a general.”

“All generals are not old. There aro
generals in the armies in Europe not
over twenty-five years of age.”

“Why, I thought the captains and
lieutenants were about that age.”

“Usually they are, but sometimes a
man gets to be a general earlier.”

“How does he do it?"

“Oh, he loses his head and does
something he wouldn't dare do in his
calmer moments. It is mistaken for
an act of bravery, and they promote
him, If he does it often enough and
doesn’t get himself killed he may reach
the grade of general.”

“I don't think that's a very nice way
of putting it.”

“Ita about true.”

“How do you, a civillan, know any-
thing about such matters?’ There was
a touch of irony in this

“Oh, I have friends who have been
there.”

“I suppose they wouldn't take you
in the army.”

“Why not?"

“In the first place, you're lame; be-
sides, you don't look very strong. And
all the soldiers I've seeh are rather
large men.”

“I don't fancy,” sald the little man,
“that if I were to present myself for
enlistment as 1 am today I would be
accepted. I couldn't even be a private
in the rear ranks. Funny, isn't it?"

Gladys did not sce anything funny
about it, but she refrained from saying
80,

“I wonder,” shé sald instead, “what
18 keeping General Herbert? Father
sald he had a special appointment.”

“I wish for your sake,” said the little
man, “that General Herbert had come
instead of your humble servant.”

“I don't.”

“Why 7"

“How do you suppose a girl Uke me
could entertain him?”

The little man laughed.

“What amuses you?” asked Gladys,

**That you should suppose that a man
Is a great big noble creature covered
with glory simply bécause he 18 a gen-
eral. How many generals’ reputations
have lasted a8 long as that of Alexan-

4

der Pope, the poet, who had a miser
able body and never a well day?”

“Papa contends,” sald Gladys
thoughtfully, “that persons admire
their opposites. - That evidently isn't
true in your case.”

“I don’t deny that I would prefer a
more imposing stature.” :

“1 don't mean that at all. What I do
mean {8 that you, a delicate, sickly
maf, don't seem to set any great store
by bravery.”

“There are different kinds of brav-
ery. Mora] bravery i8 always admira-
ble. Physical bravery is as liable to be
found In a savage as in the most civi-
lized man. That it is akin to the cour-
age of a beast Is evidenced by tho fact
that most men when, they go into a
fight are frightened’ out of their senses,
When they get into it their brutal na-
ture comes to the surface and they
fight like brutes.”

“How do you know how men feel
when they go into battle?”

The little man showed a bit of con-
fusion at the question, but was equal
to the occasion. He sald that he had
read a great deal about soldiers.

“So have I,” the girl retorted. “When
I read about a battle I always wish I
wero a man and were in it.” :

“I once read a description of a bat-
tle written by a man who had just
come out of it. He was writing at the
field hospital whére the surgeons wero
at work. His battle pictures mado me
glad that 1 wasn't in it.”

“Ob, I suppose if one Is not”—"

She got no further. Hearing the
gate clase, sho'looked around and saw
her father hurrying up the walk. On
reaching the veranda he sald:

“I am sorry, general, to have, kept
you waiting for me. ‘But I see that my

"little girl has taken good care of you."

“Your little girl bas knocked me out
at tennis.” ;

“What! Tennis? With that wound:
of yours? Gindys, what in the world
did you’ permit General Herbert to
play tennis for? You have endangered
hia life.”

- Meanwhile Gladys stood mute with

‘astonishment, to say nothing of con-

fusion. It is safd that all the scenes of
a man's life are rushed before his eyes
when he 1s drowning. Certain it {s that

Gladys retired; leaving her father's

PELEE ISLAND,

Jock Lucas {s busy shipping his crop
of plums.

Mr. Corlett Is engaged In building
operations here which he will not be
able to complete until snow flies.

John R. Beattie, charged with as-
saulting hjs wife on three successive
occasions, was fined $56 and costs by
Magistrate Leggatt, in Windsor, on
Thursday afternoon of last week,

The South Paws had their muscles
all puffed out, last week, (n anticipa-
tion of a visit from the Bear Cats
of Middle Bass, but those crafty fel-
ines must have had an intimation of
the fate which was to be meted out
to them and very wisely stayed home.

Jack Millen, who recently sold his
farm to the Gardner Bros, has been
over on the shore looking at some of
the farms over there. He says among
other things, that while the crops are
generally very good, It ain't in it with
Pelee.

Owing to the “inclemency of the
weather the fishermen are greatly
handicapped, as the steady blow
makes it impossible tq get their nets,
as the seas are very" high. Which
harks up back to Shakespeare when
he said: “What little nofse man makes
in his short time to thine unceasing
roar.” Now this don't apply to the
ladies—it means the turbulent waters
lof Linke Erie.

Time was—and not long ago—when
the sterner sex used to taka great de-
light in bringing home their demijohns
full of the spirits that cheer, but this
boon is now denied them, Instead the
good housewives take those self-same
demijohns when going to the, store
and get them filled with such peaceful
liquids_as vinegar, molasses and coal
oll. Really and truly it sounds like
the story of the battle axes and board-
Ing pikes being turned into plow
shares and pruning hooks.

Because they wanted: to gee a train
wreck two Tilbury boys, ane 8 and

deliberately attempted: to “derail the
fast C. P. R. flyer on August 31st. The
Juvenile traln wreckers appeared in
police court here Friday and the cased
was adjourned for a week, when
judgment will be passed; The C.P.R.
flyer was partially derailed on Auguts
31st, when the front truck of the en-
gine left the track and plowed up
more than 200 ties before the train
could be stopped. When the ties were
replaced the road's engineers had the
curve grade altered to make it more
safe, {f that were possible. This was
due to the belief that the speed of the
train In rounding the curve might
have been responsible for the: accl-
dent. Detective Harper, of the C. P.
R., Investigated, however, and -found
a lerge nut, which had evidently been
runjover. With this as a clue he ran
down the “desperadoes,” ‘and found
them two small lads. They admitted
that they - placed the obstruction,
which was about two inches square, on
the. track just before the flyer was
due; and naively confessed that {it
was thejr desire to see’n train wreck:

tinted this confession by.a complete
