Loftus Cuddy, Former Prominent
Amherstburg Banker, Dies Sud-
denly in New Hampshire—Shetch
of His Life—Burial in Cleveland.

Loftus Cuddy, millionaire coal and
oll operator, former resident of Am-
herstburg, died suddenly of apoplexy
at Briton Woods, the White Moun-
tains, N Hampshire, Friday noon,
August 24th, in the 64th year of his
age. Mr. and Mrs. Cuddy had gone
there on August 13th to escape the
hay fever season. He had been in the
pink of condition and- his tragic end
was a grievious shock to his wife
and family.

Mr. Cuddy's successful life is one
of thre most realistic financial ro-
mances of the age. From farmer boy
to multi-millfonnire in two score
years is so Infreqeunt an occurrence
as to be of outstanding importance.
His native home was in Adelaide
township, near Strathroy, he being
one of twin sons, born to Mr. and
Mrs. James Cuddy. His twin brother,
T. A. Cuddy, of Winnipeg, was at the
funeral. The family originally con-
sisted of twelve, two dled on shipboard
coming: from" Ireland in the early
days, and of the other ten, only two
are ‘now living, T. A, mentioned
above, and John A. Cuddy, of Ade-
lalde, father~-of C. A. Cuddy, manager
of Imperial Bank, Amherstburg,

Loftus Cuddy first entered business
a8 a young man, in the office of Alex:
ander Johnston, private banker,
Stratliroy. - In. 1878 he came-to An
Herstburg and opened a private bank
In the Lake View corner In connec-
tion with Mr. Johnston under the name
of Johnston's Bank, afterwards the
“Loftus Cuddy” Bank. Fulls Bros,
took this over In 1893 when the Qn-
tarfo Bank opened a branch in Am-
herstburg. During this time he had
become interested with the Cuddy-
Mullen fueling business in Cleveland,
and following disposal of his
banking interests devoted his whole
attention tp the conl fueling business,
his family spending their summers
here until the fall of 1895, when they
removed permanently to Cleveland
Upon the withdrawal of the Ontario
Bank from Amherstburg he acquired
a partnership in the Falls Bros. pri-
vate bank, and It became known as
the Cuddy-Fallg Co.. which was taken
over Inter by the Molsons Bank.
Cleveland Mr, Cuddy formed a part-
nership with the late Martin Mullen,
continuing in the fueling business un-
tl thelr Interests were absorbed by
the Pittsburgh Coal Co, They estab-
lished the first wholesale fueling
docks equipped with car dumping ma-
chines on the chain of lakes. Later
Me. Cuddy turned his attention to oik
Jig-operations in this fleld of endéavor
being very successful, and his wealth,
the foundation of which was laid in
Amherstburg, increased rapidly until
at his death he was reputed to be
worth” sgven million dollars. In ad-
dition to being president of the Vul-
can Oil Co, he was ‘connected as
director-and shareholder with a
ber of banks and financial institutions
and wag a calculating, shrewd and
methodical business man of large af-
fairs until the last. 2

In Amherstburg Mr. Cuddy was
married to Miss Helen Brookman,
daughter of the late Rov. Wm. Brook-
nin seelor of Christ church, and tHey
purchinsed and resided fn the besutiful
home on the river front afterwards
sald to S, Olin Johnson. Their family
consists off two sons and one daugh-
tor, all born ‘here: —Brookman, with
the British forces in England: Jeffrey,
attached to the U. S. Aviation Corps,
Cleveland, and Ethel, Mrs, Bernett, of
Birmingham, Georgia.

It 18 a remarkable commentary’ on
his attachment to early. associations
and tenacity or purpose that he al-
ways, retained his Canadian citizen-
ship. © This same tralt was seen in
his lite long Interest in Christ church,
Amherstburg, which was favored
richly by his benetactions. His great
wealth was the result of the strictest
attention to many and varied business
Interests on a magnificent scale; he
never invested a cent in any affair of
a speculative nature. Method and or-
der were the prominent character
istics of his whole personal and busi-
ness life.

The remains were brought to Cleve-
land Monday night, and the funeral
took place there Tuesday afternoon,
interment being in Cleveland.
