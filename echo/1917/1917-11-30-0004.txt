Complaints are made-that some of

aro not putting on the voters’ lists the
names of the wives, widows, mothers,
sisters and daughters of = sol
diers serving In British regiments.
They seem to imagine that only fe-
male reliatives of Canadian soldiers
are entitled to a vote. It is jmport-
ant that all such persons should know
that they are entitled to a vote, and
that the Enumerators should not over
look any of them. —The Globe.
