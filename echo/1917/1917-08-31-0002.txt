NOTED MUSICIAN
OF MONTREAL

Advises The Use Of “FRUIT-A-TIVES",
The Famous Fruit Medicine, |

 

      

MR. ROSENBURG
539 Casgrain St., Montreal.
April 20th, 1915.

“In my opinion, no other medicine
in the world is so curutive for Constipa-
tion and Indigestion as ** Fruit-a-tives”.
1wasa sufferer from these complaints for
five years, and my sedentary occupa-
tion, Music, brought about a kind of
Intestinal Pamlysis — with nasty flead-
aches, belching gus, drowsiness after
eating, and Pain in the Back, I tried
pills and medicines of physicians, but
nothing helped me. Then Iwas induced
to try ‘“Fruit-a-tives”, and now for
six months I have been entirely well.

I advise any one who suffers from that
horrible trouble— Chronic Constipation
with the resultant indigestion, fo fry
© Fyuit-a-tives’’, and you will be
agreeably surprised at the great benefit
you will recéive”.. A. ROSENBURG.
