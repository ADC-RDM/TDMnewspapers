' tial requirements. If you do not get your order for winter in early, you will disappoint yourself. Did you ‘ever think what you would do = «
without this store? Whot would it really mean to you in dollars and cents if it shut its doors? Then do not lightly pass it. The big depart- gel
mentals can never take th eplace of the store at your doors. Here are a few of our leaders. There are hundreds of other lines. Come in
to-day.
