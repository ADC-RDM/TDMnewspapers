“Realizing the need of pretty stockings to wear with
smart summer shoes, I passed on to the hosiery sec-
) and my attention was attracted to a display of SILK
CKINGS AT $1.50 A PAIR. They were in black,
le and colors.
Of course, various other qualities were on display
at hand, and the saleslady was very courteous and
med very anxious that I get just the kind and quality
"wanted, I examined these silk stockings at $1.60 a
very carefully, knowing that stockings have ad-
1 in price considerably during the past several
ths.” And I was very much surprised to note what
gi quality of silk had been used in the making of
se stockings. First of all, they were full length; the
ter tops were very deep so as to prevent any ‘run.’
© heels, toes and soles were doubly reinforced, while
silk had a very fine appearance.

found that although, as in almost every commodity, prices
sadly disarranged, they have full lines for children as

though they would give good reasonable wear. Good

The death of two Conservative Son.
ators, Senntors Baird, of New Burns:
wick, and Senator Corby, of Belleville,
makes eleven vacancies in the upper
house. They will probably be filled
immediately after the Premier returns
from England.

The agitation of Lambert Wigle, M.
P.P., against the race track evil is
bearing fruit In the way of greater
production of profits for the Govern:
ment. Hon. Mr. McGarry, Provincial
Treasurer, announced that the 10-cent
assessment tax collected at all race
tracks in Ontario will be Increased to
25 cents. to be operative ‘from May
23rd. The firm of Clarkson & Sons,
of Toronto. have been appointed to
make an Independent audit of the
books of all race tracks. The second
announcement is taken to foreshadow
legislation of more advanced nature
respecting the license fees of race
tracks,

The budget speech delivered by Sir
Thomas -White fin. the Dominion
House on Tuesday had some new and
important features regarding taxation.
While there are to be no tariff changes,
which was a surprise, as It was ex-
pected that beans would have been
placed on the free list. The new tax-
ation Is an extension of the business
profits war tax of Inst year. It is
proposed to take from all persons,
firms and companies liable under the
present act 50 per cent. of all profits
in excess of 15 per cent, but not ex:
ceeding 20 per cent. per annum, and
75 per cent. of profits in excess of 20
per cent. per annum on capital The
present tax {3 26 per cent. on profits
above 71 per cent, Under the new
legislation up to 15 per cent, com-
panies will be taxed at the present rate.
Between. 15 and 20 per cent. the Gov-
ernment will take one-half the profits,
and beyond 20 per cent. three-fourths
of the profits. The new legislation
will apply after the last accounting
perlod of the three-yecr term provided
for in the business profits war tax of
1916, December 31st last. It is ex-
pected that this will result in a large

increase p the Dominion revenue.

COVERNMENT TO BUY. SEED
GRAIN.

The expenditure of $6,000,000 on the
authority of the Governor-General's
warrants has been provided for in the
Parliamentary recess, according to a
return tabled in the Dominfon House.
The whole amount {8 to be applied to
the purchase of seed grain and $200,-

A special meeting of the Amherst
burg High School Board was held Mon:
day night, pursuant to the following
letter: “Mr. B. P. Overholt, "Sec'y
of the High School Board,—At the last
regular meeting of the Public School
Board after considerable discussion
concerning the crowded condition of
the puplls of the primary classes: ahd
the absolute necessity gt.engaging an-
other teacher which would require the

| use of another room for Public school
purposes. it was thought advisable’ to
Invite the High School Board to meet
our Board at the Poblic School on
Thursday evening, April 26th, at 8 p.
m.. for the purpose of considering ways
and means for overcoming the above
conditions {n harmony with best in-
terests of both Public and High. Kindly
arrange for your High School Board
to meet with us on the above. date.
Yours truly, Dr. W. S. French, Sec'y
Publie, School Board.”

The matter wos discussed at some
length, and the view expressed that
as the population of the town was get-
ting back to normal and likely to in-
crease appreciably within the next
year that the Public school would no
donbt require all thes rooms and thus
leave the High Schopl without a home,
it, would therefore ‘be necessary to
geek new quarters in the near future.
The members of the Board were unani-
mously of the opinion that the time
had come to look for a site and bring
the erection of a new High school
building before the atténtion of the
ratepayers. A committee was appoint-

| ed to look for avallable sites In the
town. and no doubt within a short
while the people will be apprised of

A large number of ‘sheep have al-

that owners are trying to get the crop

seen In this district. the greater pro-

seriously by the sheep.

Even the animals are seized with
the greater production Idea this year,
judging from Instances that are being
brought to the attention of The Echo.
The latest, which is well worth special
mention; is on Ed. J. Bopdy's farm.
where an old ewe |s the proud mother
of a lamb, which though only a week
old tips the scales at 15 pounds. This
is hard to beat.

Farmers in the north part of the
township have reason to be nervous
owing to the outbreak of hog cholera
on the farm of Sam Drouillard. Mr.
Drouillard recently purchased two
sows from Mr. Fleld, Skndwich East,
and after bringing them home noticed
{llnegd among his hogs, some of which
died. He notified Dr. McBride, of Am-
herstburg, and Dr. Rowe, Veterinary
Inspector, of Chatham, who also call:
ed in and found swine plague among
the animals. The both sows and six-
teen pigs had to be slaughtered, and
the premises quarantined. A close in-
gpection of adjoining premises has
been made, but no other cases have
been discovered

carrier, will sever his relations with

well, on June 30th, as Gilbert Dupuis’
tender, for the work Is only $300, or
about $1 a day. while Mr. Fryer's was
$450, same as last year When the
news became known the patrons on
the route almost unanimously signed
a petition, which was forwarded to
the Postmaster-General, urging that
Mr. Fryer be re-engaged at hig tender,
which in these "days of high living
costs, is only a small daily wage at
that. 'G. C. Anderson, P. O. Inspector,
acknowledged receipt of the petition,
Sndupropised consideration, but noth-

Mr. Fryer worked the rural delivery
system down to a scien purchasing
