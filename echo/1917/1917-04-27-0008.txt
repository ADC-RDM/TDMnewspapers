: “BY. JOHN W.S. McOULLOUGH,

creased has exhausted public patience
and forced the whole question of race-
track gambling upon the consideration
of the Legislature.

To mollify his. critics Hon. Mr. Mc-
Garry has promised (o bring before

[the Legisla*ure all necessary (nforma-

tion about thé business of horseracing
in this Province—information which
will no doubt Include returns of the
gate receipts’ and thie receipts from
the gambling privileges So it is
probable that when the Legislature
pext meets it will hove the data
necessary for intelligent consideration
of the whole race-track question.
Meanwhfle-{t is perhaps not un-
timely to inquire how It has come
about that gambling on the race track
Is the only lowful kind of gambling
in Ontario. That is, after all, the
vital question, Ther no essential
difference between betting on the turn
lof a card or ofudice, or on the revolu-
tionslof a wheel, and betting on the
result of a horse race. And yet the
gomblers who use curds, who play

roulette, who shoot craps, who throw

dice, are arrested and punished; while
the gamblers who bct on horse races
do so openly and under the protection
of the police, none daring to make
them afraid. Bpt they must do it at
the race track. If they bet with a
handbood man, away from the race
track, on the result of a race, they
[break the law. Thus crme is, under
our queer law, made a matter of top-
ography. , An act, which, when com-
mitted in one place, is lawful becomes
a crime when committed fn another
place a few yards distant,

The reason for this anomaly ig on!
the surface. It is, horse racing
is a popular sport ng an {nfluen-
tial class of the comm ty, and it 18
a sport which; apps tly, cannot
flourish without the financial support
of the gambling accompaniment. Thus,
in order that a comparatively small
number of fnfluential persons, includ:
ing legislators, may not be deprived of
thelr favorite sport, the facilities for

gambling are placed within easy reach §+

f all who may be tempted to gamble
and thousands, who but for these op-
portunities would never think of risk-
ing their mohty in games of chance,
acquire the gambling fever and suffer
loss—moral loss certainly, and, very
probably, financial loss too.

When Earl Crouchman, of Sarnia,
placed a billiard ball in his mouth on
a bet, he was unnble to remove it.
Four ‘teeth had to be removed before
the ball would come ont.
