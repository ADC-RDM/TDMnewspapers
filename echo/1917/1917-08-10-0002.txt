coLp WATER CANNING.

The natural history society of Brit-
ish Columbia has been investigating a
method of preserving fresh fruit and
vegetables in cold water only. without
cooking or sugar. Mrs. M. Rudd. of
Victoria. demonstrated before * the
committee, showing rhubarb, logan-
berries, cherries anc currants pre-
served in bottles. She said she also
had been successful with peaches,
nectarines, plams, strawberries, peas,
beans, corn and tomatoes.

“The fregh fruit is placed in"any jar
or bottle that can be sealed by a rub-
ber band or cap. The bottle or jar is
placed in a receptacle deep enough to
allow ar least four inches of water to
cover {t. The water is then” allowed
to run into each bottle or jar and coc-
tinue running until the receptacle is
full and running over so that all im-
purities are washed off.

“The bottles or jars remain undar
water until all air bubbles have cea=ed
to appear—usually about five minutes
They are then sealed under €1e water,
wiped dry, turned upsjde down and al-
lowed to remain in that position fer
twenty-four hours. If dry alter that
period. the bottle is proved to be air-
tight; if ‘not, the process must be re-
peated. The only principle seems to
be to expel the air; and keep {tl out.
The water must, of course. be pure.”

The new method Is beng tried by
some Amherstburg women and the re-
suit of the experiment will be watch-
ed with interest A
