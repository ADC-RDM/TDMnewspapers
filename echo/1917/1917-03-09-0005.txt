The annual “At Home" of the of-

The movement for. consolidated
schools {8 taking shape, as indicated
in the sentiments expressed by the
various speakers at the annual meet-
of trustees in Essex, last week. Time
and again the subject has been
thoughtfully discussed around the fire-
side by men In this district, who saw
with Harrow situated as the hub of a
wheel around which a great many
schools radiated, the nudleus of a con-
solidated system of schools for the
township, which could be more easily
arranged than fn the great majority
of places, where the sentiment may
be stronger for the proposed method
of reducing the cost of running
schools, with consequent greater ef-
ficlency In teaching naturally expect-
ed in a graded schoal. Old methods,
even if wasteful, are very difficult to
get rid of. It is only In highly organ-
ized modern manufacturing plants
that real efficiency is in evidence, but
there is no reason why ‘the wasteful
methods in vogue In maintaining
schools that might better be merged
with a central school, sould not be
taken up and discussed calmly and
fully by the people interested. Let
us have a discussion over: consoll-
dated schools as applied to Harrow
