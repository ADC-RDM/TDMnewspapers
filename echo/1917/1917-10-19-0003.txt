Stephen’ Gregory one morning, after/
reading in his newspaper that potatoes

were gelling at $4 a bushel, said to his
daughter, Minna :

i... “We have here four ncres of virgin

could hire help I would raise what yeg-
etables we need for the coming snm-
mer. But I can't hire help; there is
none to be hired. Any man who is able
to work can do better than wdrk for
what I could afford to pay him.”

“Couldn't you turn over the ground
to be worked by some one on shares?”
asked the young lady.

“I could give it to some one outright,
I suppose, but there fs so much idle
land that I doubt if I could get any
one to work our'ground and pay me a
royalty. However, I'll advertise it and
6¢e what I can do.”

“I-want to do something to help in
this season of necessity.”. sild Minna.
“What can I do?”

“You might make a lst of those ar.
