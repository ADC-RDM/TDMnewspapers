particularly good qualities from the

Harrow and vicinity are due for an: |

now on. Willlam Walls, manager of
the Quality Canners, with factories at
McGregor and Cottam, has been in!
communication with Reeve Clark and
the council, and has made arrange.
ments for a meeting with the council
next Monday for the purpose of secur-
ing, It possible, on terms agreeable to
both parties, the old canning factory,

up ao big pack of corn and peas. The
proposal has been received with en-
thuslasm, and'no doubt arrangements
will"be entered Into to this end. With
two factories running full blast the
coming season, & lot of the losses
made during. the bad seasons of the |
past could be met up with. |

The church going people of Harrow |

odist Sunday school; 11 a.m. {n the |
Presbyterinn church; 3 p.m. in the |
Baptist church, and at 7.30 p.m. in the!
Methodist church. The evening ser-
vice wags very largely attended, when
a congregation Which taxed the capac- |
Ity of the church greéted the speaker.
On Monday Mr. Wickware gave three
addresses. He spoke in the,Continu- |
ation school at 2 p.m.; in the Bap-|
tist church at 3 p.m., and in the Meth- |
odist church at 8 pm. An offering
was taken to aid him in his work. Mr.
Wickware is a most enthusinstic
speaker and enlisted the sympathy of
his hearers as he In n most vivid and
lucid manner set before them the con-
ditions of the pedple mn South Africa
and the" great work he. is doing.

Mrs. Robert Grant {8 on the sick
list. ;
Some forty guests greatly enjoyed
the celebration of Miss Ethel Huff-
man's 17th birthdey at the home of her
parents, Monday evening, Games,
musfc and other social amusements
combined to make the ovening one of
great pleasure for all. The young lady |
was ‘remembered with kindly gifts.
Reeves Upcott, of Gosfleld South,
and Clark, of Colchester South, ‘com-
missioners appointed at the last meet-
ing of the county council to let a
contract and superintend the building
of a new bridge and grade over Cedar
Creek, In this township, have let the
contract for a new steel bridge! to;
James McGill, for $8,885 with piling |
ond grading $1,000, The new struc-
ture will have ao span of 90 feet, and
will be rushed to completion early in
the summer. The grading will be ex-
tensively piled on both sides and made

It was a great shock to the people
of the township to learn Thursday
morning that Melville Drummond, a
native of this place, and until last
fall a resident, had died suddenly the
night before in Windsor. Mr. Drum-
mond suffered'for a week with a gor: |
buncle on his neck, and- infection from
this caused blood poisoning an 1 pneu- |
monia, and the end came almost be-
fore the family realized the serious
nature of his {liness. The funeral took
place Friday

 

at the home by Rev. W. E. Pescott.
Deceased was-the eldest son of. the
late Joséph * Drummond, Township
Clerk, and was 61 years of.age. He
moved to the city before Christmas
and was employed In a lucrative po-
sition at the M. C. R. roundhouse. He
was highly respected and widespread:
sorrow was caused by his death. He
was twice married, first to Miss Ade-
line Buchanan, by whom he had one
daughter, Mrs. Josle Wigle, of Kings-
ville. His second wife was the widow
of Thomas Quick. She survives him
together with three daughters and one
son. There are nlso his aged mother,
slsters, Mrs. Alanson Scratch, of Gos-
field South; Mra. I.. EB. Webster and
Mrs. Maggie Shepley, of Harrow, and
«brothers James and Carey, of Harrow.
For the second time in two months
Mrs. Nellle Pastorius, widow of the
late Ernest Pastorius, recelved a
shock’ which * was
nervous prostration to any ordinary
woman, on Thursday evening of last
week, when her 14-year-old daughter,
Mabel, was so badly, burned at their
home on Moy avenue, Windsor, that
shé succumbed ip Hotel Dieu early
Friday to her Injuries. This second
accident has aroused the sympathy of
nearly evrybody In this township,
