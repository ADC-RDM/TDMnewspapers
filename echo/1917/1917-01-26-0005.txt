For the first time In a month a
car of chestnut coal cane to Harrow
Tuesday night, and n t since the last
bjg dallvery of tobacco has. such a
rush been seen about the P. M. sta-
tian. At times there.were forty-eight
teams in procession waiting to get the
small supply that was doled out to
each applicant, In order to make the
car go' as far as possible in relieving
the ‘coal famine fn this district, the
largest amount given .to any person
was 500 pounds, and’ many who! never
expected to shovel coal, at least not
in this world, were glad to climb in
the car and grab a shovel to fill their
boxes, bags and other receptacles they.
had for carrying away their share. It
was a case of every man “doing his
bit,” and doing it as kindly as he
could. . Mr. Ferriss acted impartially
with it as fer as the car load went.
There has been great suffering for
lack of coal in many quarters. Some
drove to’ Amherstburg and other points
to keep themselves supplied but many
were unable to go that distance, so
stoves have been out which should
have been Keeping portions of the
houses warm, resulting In ‘sickness
and suffering.

Lennox Thompson, an “old resident
resident of this township, passed away
at his ‘home, East Harrow, Tuesday af-
ternoon, aged 79 years. He had been
In fair health until a week.ago, when
he was seized with pneumonia, and
his age wus ‘against his recovery
from this dread disease. Mr. Thomp-
son was born in Ireland. He was a
son of the late Thomas Thompson, J.
P., who came to Colchester inthe
carly days. THey settled on the El
liott farm, lake front, now known as
the Jacob McLean place, later moving
to Maidstone, where they lived a
number of years, returning to Har:
row, where he dled. The subject of
this sketch was twice married, first to
Miss Martin, They had several chil-
dren, all of whom are dead. Hia sec-
ond wife, who survives him, was a
Miss Mulligan, of Essex. They had
two children, Miss Eva and Ivan, both
at home. Thero are besides two als-
ters, Mrs. W. J. Halstead, Colchester
South, and Mrs. Margaret Rush, of
Fort Dodge, Iowa. The funeral was
held yesterday (Thursday) afternoon
to St. Andrews English church, Har-
row, where services were conducted
by the Rev. J. W. Connor, rector,, and
burial was in old Christ church ceme-
tery. The bereaved family will have
the loving sympathy jot a large num-
ber of friends.

Philip Ferriss, the oldest man in the
township, now In his 93rd year, has
been very poorly. While he has had
remarkable strength for one so old,
liuman machinery will only run so
long, and he is beginning to feel the
weakness brought on by. the weight of
years. He is now moking®a good re-
covery ‘and it {8 expected that he will
regain some of his strength.
