Two noted scientists, by experiments on

animals, have proved that youthfulness de-

ds og the thyroid gland.” And that some-
ing in oats séems to feed that gland.

It appears that old age can be deferred
many years by caring for this gland. The
full caro is t feed it, and the proper food
S oats.

' Oats contain more en food, more
food forthe brain, more food for the nerves,
than Any other grain that grows. And now it
seems that they also servetp’keep one young.

But common oatmeal isn't good. enough
for such an important diet. The rich,
plump grains alone are used'in the miking
of Quaker Oats. They are selected b
siftings, nnd only ten pounds are. obtained
from a bushel. g

THE STAY_AT HOME VOTE

Evil Effact of Neglect of Duty bythe
3 Indifferent Citizen.

Qur most important elections are of-
ten decided by the stuy at heme vote.
Tho course of the government, ita pol
icles, our entire administration of pub-
lle affairs, turn in effect upon the
indifference of the citizen. The evils
that dow from his neglect of those
primary dutics may be said to be the
beginning of all those evils that seem
ever to accompany frée government

11 the people were as vigilant about

No one could understand why it was
that Helen Ayer, the Wife of an excels.
lent man and the Mother of a lovely.
boy six years old, fell under the fnflu-
ence of Schuyler @nigley, with nothing
except swagger aid cheek to recom-
mend him. When Quigley first began
to pay attention to Mrs, Ayer her hus-
band did not appear to notice it. The
truth is he saw that his wife was drift-
ing away from him and be dared not
oppose her, fearing that by his very
opposition be might bring about a ca-
tastrophe. If he permitted the matter
to work itself gut perhaps the wife and
mother would {0 time tire of her new
fancy. and / realize -the danger to her-

self, her husbard and ber son.

Ayer had no faith in the effectiveness
of opposition fn such a case. Hg pre-
ferred to rely on some appeal to the
heart guch a be was not in a position
to make hfsaself and which could only
come to hi$ Wife unbidden. He hoped
that some incident, some evidence
thrust before her suddenly,” might
sweep the dust from before her. eyes
and she would see her position in its
true light. He had perfect confidence
In her purity. If Quigley succeeded in
taking her away from him he must do
it legitimately. Sbe must be divorced
from tho one and married to the other.

With this fidea in view he made no
complaint to Helen, leaving her perfect
freedom to dio as she liked. He never
objected to Quigley coming to the
house, nor did he oppose Helen's go-
ing out with him. He endeavored in
every possible way to show his faith
in her. Had Quigley taken himselt
away fior awhile possibly the spell that
bound her to him might have been bro-
ken, or at least it might baye begn
breakaible. =

But Quigley was so aggressive, so
persistent, that Helen never got away
from a certain dominating force there
was albout him long enough to recover
bersellf. Finally Ayer decided to take
action. (Since they all belonged to the
same sett, ho had frequent opportunity
to meet tthe man who was undermining
his home. Thelr first meeting was at
tho “howse of a mutual friend, where a
numhser of men were accustomed to,
nilay poker. Ayer's object was tq begin
a series of attempts to force a quarrel
upon Quigley, concealing the. true
cause. The better to cover his motive
at the poker party he mot Quigley cor-
dially, But during the game he sud-
denly arose from the table, declaring
that he would not play with a cheat,
making it plain that Quigley was ths
man referred to.

Quigley, who was perfectly innocent
of the charge, retorted. High words
followed, and Ayer struck him. Quig-
lby was prevented from returning; the .
blow by the. others,” who protested
ngningt, the ‘men fighting under -the
host's roof about a matter of cheating
at’ cards, thereby bringing a’ scandal
upon the house and the party. .

This left Quigley not only under a
disgraceful charge, but as having re-;
ceived a blow from Ayer that he had
not returned. Under the old regime
of a century or more ago he would
have been’obliged to challenge Ayer or
be cut by his friends. Living in the
twentieth century, ho was. not obliged
to do anything. He let the matter
drop. He did not call at Ayer's house
any more, but he met Mrs. Ayer when
sho went out on the street and at the
houses of mutual friends, All he said
to ber about his troubles with her hus-
band was that Ayer had accused him
of cheating at cards and that every
member of the party present had ex-
onerated him of the charge.

And'so it was that Russell Ayer by
trying to get rid. of the man who was
really his wife's worst enemy, and at
the samo time prote¢t her good name,

choosing their public servants as they
are about choosing their corporate offi
cers or their trusted employees it
would be virtually impossible for ex.
travagance or graft or the many evils
‘of bossism to exist under our form of
government.

‘We have given muoch attention of
Iate to what is called a movement for
popular government. We havo consid-
ered the advisability of incorporating
into our system of government the in-
itiative, the referendum and the re-
call. We have at times become violent
in expressing a desire for what we
choose to call more effective instru-
mentalities of government. Apparent-
1y wo have coveted greater obligations
and more manifold and complex du-
. Putting aside for a time the question
of any benefits to be derived from
adopting and using such instrumental-
ities of government, the questions re-
main: Wonld we use them if wo bad
them? Would they not le like tools
by cur side, rusting and cumbersome?

THE TOMB OF EVE.

Where the Mother of the Human Race
Is Said to Rest In Arabia.

What is probably the most remarka-
ble and strangest of all’alleged Bible
tombs: is that which marks the sup-
posed resting place of Eve, the mother
of the human race. It les about a
mile to the north of Jeddah, the port
of Mecca.

The tradition that Eve was buried
here is older than Mohammed. Adam
is believed by some to rest at his own
peak in Ceylon, but this is debated by
oriental scholars,

There bad been a difference, so the
Mobamgmedans say, between our first
parents, and Eve spent the last years
of her life at Jeddah, ‘where she was
buried, not far from the great templo
fn Mocca, which Moslem tradition
ascribes to the hands of Adam him-
self.
A common legend attributes to Eve
the height of 118 feet, but this does
not correspond with the, dimensions of
her tomb, .which is neerly 400 feet
long! She must have been of a 'some-
what strange shape, as her grave is
dnly ten or eleven feet wide!

In the middie of the grave Is a small
building cootaining™a curious witness
to the devotion of.the Moslems. On
the whitewashed walls of this little
temple are hundreds of thousands. of

Well?’ Vision of the Future.

, In the last fow years I have devel
oped a religious belief that has now
become to mo as real as any common-
place fact. K.think that mankind fa
still, as it were, collectively dreaming
and hardly more awakened to. reality
than a véry young ¢hild It bas these
dreams that we express by the fiags of
nationalities and by strange loyalties
and by irrational creeds and ceremo-
nics, and {ts dreams at times become
such nightmares as this war. But the
time draws near when mankind will
awake and the dreams will fade away,
and then there will be no nationality
in all the world but humanity and no
king, no emperor, no leader but the
one God of kind, This is my
faith. 1 am as certain ‘of this as I
was in 1000 that men would presently
fly. To mo it is as if it must be so.—

GROWING TOBACCO SEED.

In. years past the lack of strong’

viable seed” has caused the tobacco
growers of Ontario tonsiderable trou-
ble and some loss. This can asily be
remedied if each tobacco grawer would
select a few seed plants and grow his
own seed. ‘

On the Harrow Tobacco. Station it
has ‘been found that good home grown
seed not only produces plants’ which
mature carlier in «the field but also
produces earlier, more uniform seed-
lings In the plant bed than forelgn
grown soed,

In selecting seed plants the field
should be carefully gone over before
topping, and about twicé as many
plants selected as ire required for the
amount of seed-t6 be produced. The
plants selected sheuld be typical of
the type of tobacco grown, early, with
a good sized leaf of good shape and
the distance between the leaves on the
stalk should not be too long The
number of leaves on theplant and the
color of the leaves about ripening time
should also be taken Into considera-
tion,

After the first selection these plants
should be cdrefully studied from time
to time and any developing undesir-
able characteristic discarded,

Before the first flowers opan each
seed head should be trimmed up until
only the fine top branches are left.
It should. then be covered with a 14-
pound man{lla bag che mouth of which
18 tldd loosely around the stalg just
below the lowest camaining hranclies.

About every ten days these bags
should ba removed ond all suckers,
late pods, and fallen blossoms taken
out arter which the bags should be re-
placed.

Wuoen the seed. pods are sll formel
and begin to turn Orown the bags
should be taken off and the seed heads
allowed to ripen in ihe open. By do-
{ng this the pods muure earlier and
there {8 not so much danger of them
moulding,

After the greater ‘portion of tlie
seed pods turn brown the seed heads

should be harvested and hung in a}:
dry place for about two montas, after | fi

which they should be shelled.
