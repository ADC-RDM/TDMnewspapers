My very dear John:

I have been intending to
write you a letter for along time. In |
fact, when I wha way down an Lemnos
Island in the Agean Sea, I began a let-
ter to you which contained a nerrative
of my doings and manoeqverings frem
the time of reaching Enktand with my
old ‘Unit until 1 landed at Lemnos. Un-

within an ace of causibg my death.

Echo, but ft wns a cage of man pro-
poses and God disposes. I became too
[ilk to write. A

By this time, my dear, John, you
must be well-posted and informed of
all the things that have! happened to

the time we left Canada. which was

to England. On my landing, 1 was
ordered to the Dardanelles. The rea-
son given for this change of program,
as far as I was concerned, was that
two other O. C.'s of Canadian Units,
when ordered to proceed to the Darda-
nelles, positively and emphutically re-
fused to go. The War Office, which

with a loss of 1,800 lives, We were
following in her waké, which was the
shortest route to Mudros, our course
lying between Caros and - Carpathos.
On the Sunday morning following, at
6 a.m. we were signalled by a French
torpedo boat destroyer to stop. We
did so immediately. The captain
boarded our ship, and not being able
to speak English, I acted as inter-
preter for him. He told us of our dan-

| time 60 per cent. of my unit was in
bed in Hospital, utterly incapacitated
and without proper food and the ne-
cessary medicines to ‘combat the
dreadful disease, Two of my nurses,
Mrs. Gagegard, the Matron, a first
cousin of Sir Robert Borden, and
Nursing Sister Murna succunmbed in 14
days after their arrival, and no woc-
cupy unwept, but honored graves in
God's acre in-the rear of the. little
Greek church; situated on the slope of
la hill * 2 miles from our. camp near
the Greek village of Portiana.
On.our arrival we set immediately
to work pitching hospital tents, mak-
ing latrines and digging sewers. In
3 days' time, in spite of the intense
heat, a sufficient number ‘of tents
was erected to accommodate 300 pa-
tients, who arrived from Gallipoli’s
blpod-steeped. promotory, 30. miles
away. The reception and lodging of
this number of patients, so soon after
onr arrival, was considered by Inspec-
tor-General Bapfie a marvel of celer-
ity and hard work. ' He complimented
me on the fact, and that the Canadians
showed dan example In industry, work
and speed to the British. The wan
faces, emaciated figures, deep-sunken
Justreless eyes, listless actions, rag-
ged and torn and blood-stained clothes
of the men from Gallipoli proved only |
too conclusively the terible sufferings
and hardships undergone«by them
during their stay on tiffs now famous
peninsula, which is the ‘burial place
of thousands of the Empirgs bast
men. From. Lemnds we conld easily
hear .the~ roaring "of >the eannon.
Gallipoli, as well 28 see by night, the
reflection of the searchlights and ex-
plogives on the sky. These sounds
and sights by day and night were
stern reminders to us of the terrible
slaughter thant was going on at our
very doors. What victims shot and
shell did not claim among the men
dysentery did. It would take a mod-
«rn Homer to relate becomingly, and
to do justice to the many acts of bray-
ery and heroism exhibited by our sol-
diers on  Gallipoli's hlood-stained
shores, At the end of September I
became violently fll. After a consul-
tation held over me by doctors of my
own unit, and the goveinment special~
ist on tropical diseases, I was ordered
off the island and dent to Alexandria,
where I was a patient in No. 9 Brit-
ish hospital for six weeks, For the
first few weeks I hovered between
life and death, re¢laved the last rites
of my church, and was prepared to
cross the Great Divide.' I am free to
confess that I did not want to dle, al-
though 1 placed my faith entirely in
the hands of the Almighty: I prayed |
hard to be granted, the privilege of
reaching British soil and resting In its
hospitable hosom, My. prayer was
granted, ns far as getting back to Brit-
ain was concerned. In the heginning
of November, 1915, I landed in
“Blighty,” still very (ll, but. gradually
improving.: After a three weeks’ so-
journ in Alexandria hospital, London;
and two in Helena hospital, Shorn-

. Doctors, lawyers, salosmen, bakers, grocers and farmers

Its low cost appeals to them. Its unusually low upkeep

acter wins them and satisfies them. Even the wealthy
