VINES FOR SHADE.

What to Choose to Scresn Your Porch
or Your Back Fence.

Vines for shading purposes require
dense growth. One of the ways to get
this after the proper ones have been
selected” Is to insure good soll, plenty
of water and frequent cultivation.
Vines must make, their growth quickly
and uninterruptedly to. make good
screening or shading, and for this rea.
son hardy perennial ones are best.

To show rapid top growth a vine
must. have a large root mass. This
can be assured by planting in a spe |
clally prepared trench or pit excavated
to a depth of eighteen inches. - If the

Both ‘these vines for shaded places

“the meridian exactly at 12, and it can
