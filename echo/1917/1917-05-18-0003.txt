THE UNDERFED

How Children of the Ignorant
Are Robbed of Oatmeal

A canvass made among the intelligent
shows that seven homes in eight serve
catmeal. Among the ignorant another can.
vacs shows that not one home in twelve
perves oats. The children grow up incapa-
ble because bodies and brains are starved.

Nature stores in outs more energy food,
more brain food, more nerve food than in
any other grain that grows. That's why
children crave oatmen.. There is nothinfy
to take its place.

This is a food on which it doesn't pay to
be careless, There is a very wide differ:
ence in oat foods—a difference in richness
and food value. Don’t serve the common
kind.

Only the richest, plumpest grains are
used in Quaker Oats. They are selected
by 62 siftings. Only ten pounds are obtain
ed from a bushel. The result is a food rich
in all the oat elements—the utmost in oat-
meal.e Yet the cost to you is but one-half
cent per dish, r

Mndo in Canada.

~—The Dominion Agricultura) De-
partment has {8sued the following ad-
vice: “The enthusinsm displayed gen-
erally ‘in the matter of planting pota-
toes Is only equalled by the enthus-
insm with which potato prices are
climbing up. It now costs from $45 to
$50 for seed to plant an acre of pota-
toes. It is obvious that at these
prices potatoes do not give a sufficient
food value. Housekeepers could well
eliminate the potato and tarn to more
economie foods, and, by such elimin-
atlon, leave that much more seed to
be planted for the much-needed crop
this year. In the scarcity of potatoes
it would be well for planters to turn
to the question of- beans. The same
money that will plant an acre of po-
tatoes, if Invested in beans, will pro-
vide seed. for more than ten acres.
They are not only an excellent and
nutritious form of food,: but It lopks
as if they will continue to be in strong
demand for army supplies, and ¢om-
panies, with army contracts, are offer
jng as high as $5 a bushel for this
year's crop. Soll that [s suitable for
potatoes is generally also suitable for
beans.”

WINTER HARD ON
CANADIAN CROPS

The first crop report of the present
season, issued by the census and sta-
tistics office and made public on Mon-
day, relates to the area nnd condition
of the winter wheat crop, the condi-
tion of hay and clover meadows at the
end of the winter and the progress of
spring seeding, as reported by corres-
pondents at the end of April.

The area estimated to be:sown to
winter wheat last fall is 813,400 acres,
of which 656,600 acres are in Ontario,
105,700 in Saskatchewan, 38,000 In Al.
berta, 8,000 in Manitoba, 6,200 in Brit-
Ish Columbia. In Ontario the propor-
tion of the area reported to be winter
killed is 26 per cent.; in Manitoba .14
per cent, in Alberta 16 per cent. and
In. British Columhia eight per cent.

The result is a total estimated de-
struction “through winter killing of
187,000 acres of fall sown wheat, or 23
per: cent. © This proportion is larger
than in any of the two previous years.
After deduction of the area estimated
to be winter-killed, the. area to. be
harvested is 626,400 acres; :

_The condition of winter wheat Is re-
ported as 67 per cent. of the standdrd
representing a full crop in Ontario,
656 per cent. In Manitoba, 88 per cent,
in Alberta and 85 per cent. In British
Columbia, making the figure for all
Canadn, Saskatchewan excepted, to be
69 per cent.. This is a lower percent-
8ge than any previous record for the
same date ince 1909 and reflects the
oxceptional severity of Inst winter.
Owing to the lateness of spring this
year, it was too early on April 30th
to judge of the extent to which: hay
and clover meadows have suffered the
effects of the winter, but indications
are that about nine per cent. of the
area under these crops has been win-
ter killed.” The condition fn percent
