GOOD AS THE WHEAT.

“Good as the wheat” is an old motto, about ns. much the lagt
wopd in meaning as “Safe as the Bank of England.’* LA bag full
No. 1 Northern, clean as a whistle of cockle and foxtail, was a
symbol of sure value long before gold was known 'in the world.
Wheat has been found in the Pyramids. The Egyptians just
about worshipped wheat. The Bible calls ft corn; so do the Eng-
lish. But when we say‘ "Good as the whent” we refer to the.
bushel of brown, hard kernel§ worth by Government fixture this
year, $2.20. In the memory of living maw when did “good as the
Wlheit mean more then it does now? Never. A bag of wheat’
welziing two bsuhels and a peck tots. mp (n 1917 to just. about
the value of a fivedlollpr gold piece.” But of course no man .
wants gold for his wheat. All he gots is a check made out inv“
his favor on some bank and signed by, the manager of #6me ele- #

» votor company or millfhg concern. The clieck Is converted into

"bills or goes on’ deposit. Good wheat: good paper; nobody asks
any questions. Because the company i8 O. K. and the bank f8*
found. If any wheat seller had any doubt of either he would at e,
once dempnd something else, J

J
“I sold good wheat,” he would say. “I want something as
good In exchange.”

¥ What made the wheat good? The good’ farmer behind it. A

poor farmer can make good seed into poor wheat.

Whatymakes the paper money goed? The security of the
corporation ‘whose name it bears. The spunder the corporation, A
the nearer the paper comes to being as good as the wheat. But
even a big companyy may go “broke.” pe of the corporation
is a concern whose gunrantee on a piéce of paper Is better:
than either.’ The pledge of the Dominion of Canada to pay any= "="
man money for value received is as good as the whent and as

safa as the Bank of England.

The best pledge of the Dominion of Canada to pay fs a Can-
adian Victory Bond; better than checks or bills—AS GOOD AS
THE WHEAT! Suppose you change that twenty bags of wheat
on your wagon, not into’n ¢heck or notes or even gold; but into
Canadian Victory Bonds of $50 each, bearing interest at five and
one-half per cent per annum and as negotiable on the markot as
the best €heck or the best lond of wheat yon ever saw? I
worth considering.
