Women's New Spring

bbb dd

Not every day from now on is to be so cold that furs
and heavy coats will be needed. Even now we are having p
days when the sunshine is warm enough to impress upon
you the thought that Spring is fast approaching. The well
dressed woman and the woman who has learned that it is
wisest to dress with the weather, are planning accord-
ingly and buying the new Spring coats now.

Simply come in and try one of the new Spring coats
on. Learn how really effective and attractive they are.

Take Our Advice---
Buy These $1.50
Navy Blue Serges NOW.

It will hardly be necessary to repeat that many blue
serges are not as plentiful as they have been in past years.
What is more, this is just the right shade, the quality is
exceptionally good, and we candidly believe that at $1.50
a yard these are the best serges to be found hereaboiits.
A good idea would be to make your oavn comparisons, for
then you can be convinced quickly. Other serges at
popular prices.

THE SHRIEVALTY.

Sorrow is general throughout the
county, this week, over the death of
Sheriff J. E. d'Avignon, who for his
many kindly qualities had endeared
himself to a large number of people
in Essex county. The position of
Sheriff is an important and lucrative
one, and will be a splendid post for o
returned eoldler, to one of whom It
will no doubt be given, as it is an al-
most unbroken rule that returned sol-
diers be chosen for vacancies In the
Government service. This makes the
second good position opened in Essex
county by the denth of an official—
the other being the governor of Essex
county gool. It is taking the Govern-
ment quite a while to make up its
mind in regard to the returned soldier
for the Intter job. It {8 hoped that the
Shrievalty will not be hung up in-
definitely, while political hacks are
pressing their claims.

DEATH OF SHERIFF D'AVIGNON.

J. Eugene d’Avignon, Sheriff of Es-
sex county since December 1st, 1908,
when he was appointed to succeed the
late Sheriff J. C. Iler, died in his home,
Dewar Terrace, 6 Wyandotte street,
West, Windsor, at 6 a.m. Monday, fol-
lowing a brief illness from pleurisy
and pneumonia. He was taken ill a
week ago last. Friday with pleuripy
and a few days before his death
pneumonis developed.

Sheriff d'Avignon, born in June, 1845,
came to Windsor about 33 years ago
from Montreal. dn the latter city he
was active in military circles, serving
with honor and prominence in the Vie-
torin Volunteer Rifles during the Fen-
fan troubles of 1866 and 1870. For his
efforts he was rewarded with a medal
and grant.

On coming to Windsor Mr, d'Avig-
non purchased the drug store of Geo.
H. Leslie. This business he conducted
up to the time he was appointed Sher-
