It Started a Romance

By WILLARD BLAKEMAN

there ‘was something about Lim tha

a girl of twenty gladly leave n youn
man. of twenty-five to chat with the
old gentleman, very much to th
younger one's dissatisfaction, 1 like
to hear him tell bis escapades, and ond
day he related the following story:
When 1 was a young man a rallrond
train was a very different conveynnee
from what It Is now. There were no
sleeping or parlor cars. the coupling
was the old method—by means of pin
and link, permitting the ears to swine
from side to side—and, as for lights
there were nothing but lanterns. Whe:
a train passed through n tunnel these
lanterns were left unlighted and the
passengers In darkness,

I was traveling one day on one of
these loosely bound tozether tralng—1
think I was nineteen years old at the
time—when (I had an adventure which

We rode on together for another ten
miles, when tho girl began to gather
her belongings. Thank heavy en, she was
preparing to alight! True enough,
When the next station, Talbotsy illo,
was announced by the brakeman the
young Indy arose from ber seat and
moved to the door. She had scarcely
reached it before | changed my seat for
the one she had left and begun my
search,

I looked on the seat. 1 looked on the
floor. I lit a match to seo better whilo
hunting beneath. No pln was to be
seen. I examined the aisle between the
seat I bad occupied and that on which
tho girl had sat. 1 was doomed to dis.
appointment,

I now suspected that sho bad my pin.

I left the train at the next station,
took a cab and rode back to Talbots-
ville. There I visited the two news-
paper offices of the place and left an
advertisement at each stating that a
mosaic scarfpin had been lost on a cor-
tain train and the finder would be prop-
erly rewarded for Its return; no ques-
tions asked. Then I went to my home,
having left instructions at the offices of
the papers to send me any replies that
might come for me,

A couple of days Inter I received a
letter signed Julla Waterman stating
that she had found a mosuie sc arfpin
on the train mentioned. As to “no
questions asked,” the finder of the pin
would ask the questions. She would
return the pin without reward after
the loser had explained how he came to
lose it,

My susplclon of an amused smile was
now explained. The girl had had my
pin all the while 1 was looking for if.
It was evident that I must confess, I
wrote Miss Waterman that'no girl with
such kissable lips should be pertnittga
to travel on any traln that passed
through a tunnel, for they offered an ir
resistible temptation... I was quite will.
ing to give my pin, though it was a
gift from my dear mother, for the kiss
I had taken, It grew sweeter each day
in my memory. If she would aceept
the one fu lieu of the other I would
consider the account closed,

The next day I recovered my scarf-
pin by express and a note saying that
the writer had no kisses to dispose of
in exchange for anything. She resery-
od the right to give her kisses to whom-
soever she might choose. Not another
word did she write. There was no de-
mand for an apology or for a confes-
sion from me that 1 had committed a
wrong. What I didn't like about It
was that it closed the incident.

Now, I did not propose that it should
be closed. 1 wished to form the young
lady's acquaintance with a view to zot-
ting another kiss. One more? No: a
dozen, A dozen? "No; a hundred, a
thousand, ten thousand. But how re-
open tho matter? I mpst invent some
plan. Almost any plan would do. pro-
vided the young lady would. bo pleased
to mako my acquaintance.” No plun
would suffice if she desired tbat tho
matter be dropped. In other words, 1
might be the gainer by pushing on, and
if 1.did not push on I would certainly
be a loser.

I wrote her that I would be glad to
explate my robbery by giving her my
scarfpin, but since she would not ac-
cept {tein exchange for what I had
taken, I would be only too glad to do-
nate it or its value to.any charity she
might designate. Zbia xyguld. not “toe
disposing of the kiss for her own bene-
fit, but for the rellef of the needy.
With this note 1 sent the scatfpin.
The offer without the pin would have
been useless. By sending the pin I
forced her to take another step,

When aswoman gives way to a per-
sistent admirer, she 1s apt to do so all
of a sudden. Miss Waterman replied
to my note In a very different veln than
before. She wrote ‘mo that I had be-
haved very well in atoning for wy
fault. As to what should be done with
tho pin, perbaps we had better talk the
matter over. ' She would be pleased to
have'me call upon ber for the purpose
on a certain evening,

when he saw 'a certain maneuver of
the enemy, closed his fieldglass, consid-
ering the battle won. I folded Missy
AVaterman’s note, considering that an
acquaintance was effected. No more
skirmishing was néeded. On the evens
ing designated I-went over to the place
of ber residénce on a train and at 8
o'clock in the evening appeared at her
liome.

Miss Waterman must have regretted

aly and of tho Tyrol In tho latter
country there has been of recent years
a decided rovival of interest in these
groups representing the nativity of
Christ.

It {8 not unusual to sce ono with sev-

eral hundred figures. Not alone the
birth of the Saviour, but the adoration
of the shepherds, the arrival of the
kings with thelr soldiers and courtiers,
tho flight into Egypt, Jesus fn the tem.
ple, and ‘even the marriage at Cana
are represented.

The Tyrol's cribs have been famous
for centuries, and the people were Just.
ly proud of them untll the spirit of
“modern enlightenment invaded the
land and crib building was denounced
as child’s play. Enterprising antiqua.
rians and art sellers eagerly’ bought up
all the old cribs and then sold them at
good profit to tourists.

Many fine specimens have disappear.
od from the land, Lot fortunately a
few of tho best were acquired by na-
tional museums. The best two Tyrol is
known to have had, the “Ursullpen-
krippe” of Innsbruck and the Moser
crib of Bozen, arc now in the Bavarian
National museum at Munich. A third,
the Jdufenthaler crib, is in the Vienna
museum,

Originally~it belonged to a familysin
Wilten, now a part of Innsbruck. It
contained 154 animal figures, 24 bulld-
Ings and 256 human figures. It in.
cluded solid woodearvings, figures the
beads of which were wax and others
whose heads and ]imbs were movable.
Some of theso date back as far as the
year 1700. Seven scenes were repro-
sented.

The Moser crib of Bozen was much
more extensive. Moser's “city” was in
itself a masterpiece and Included pal
aces, gushing fountains, monuments
of King David and towers with six
city clocks striking the hours of the
night. It was valued at more than
$5,000 during Moser's lifetime.

The Ursulines’ crib was particularly
famous on account of the gorgeous
dressing of the figures. The angels
were clad as courtiers of heaven in
the rich court costumes of” tho seven-
teenth century.

These masterpieces are now lost to
Tyrol. It can hardly ‘cause surprise,
then, that serions minded men began
to entertain grave fears for their re-
maining works of art. This fear had a
practical result in the formation of a
soclety whose object was te prevent in
future the ‘reckless cxportation apd
selling of old cribs and to revive tho
spirit that produced them.

two general clasSes, the oriental type
