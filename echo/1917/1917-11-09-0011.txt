In Ontario they will take, as the
basis for their work, the last lists
prepared under the provincial. law,
which was superseded by the Act of
this last sesasfom of the Legislature.
From those lists the enumerators will
delete the names of persons disquall-

In cities and towns of 9000 popula~

Franchise Act of 1917, and consti.
tuted “boards of hppeal” for Dominion
purposes.

For the purpose of allocation of

and the Bad §Veather.

It was a wise old wit who remarked
that if talk abont our aches and pains
were suppressed a thind of the conver.
sation of civilized life would cease. If
to this interdicted subject were added
that of unsatisfactory weather another
third would be thopped off.

It is amazing to bear humanity de
voting 80 much of the brief time allot
ted us here to painfully detailed ding-
noses of our headaches, backaches,
stomach aches and innumerable other
miseries.

The comical part of {t les in the sol-
emn patience with which each listens
to the other. He or she knows, how-
ever, that his or her turn comes next,
and the luxury of anloading sickening
accounts of sickness will be indulged.

Many of us are not miserable enoagh
with the pains of the present, but must
treasure up the pains of the past as
constantly accumulating reservoirs of
misery and borrow them of the future
as a debt under which to groan and
grumble.

If we could forget it all and permit
others to forget it, throwing open our
spiritual side to the boundless bless-
ings offered it, what a universe of joy
and cheer and brightness before un-
seen would'lle before us!

It is all 8 matter of mental turn, We
may shut tho shades of the windows
of our minds on the sunny side and
moan in darkness, or we may open the
same windows wide and laugh in the

sunlight.
FORGED ANTIQUES.

Even British Museum Experts Have
Been Fooled by Them.

The “antiquity” manufacturer is a
man who thrives on expert forgery.
Furmitire, prints, china, pictures, plate,
tapestry—he imitates them all most
successfully. Each man has his spe-
cialty. One devotes himself to old
leather jacks,’ another produces hom
books, a third turns out “medieval”
MSS,

The British museum once bought a
Palissy plate for $250. While an at-
tendant was handling it one of the
seals attached to ita back attesting fts
genuineness became detached, disclos-
ing the mark of a modem French pot-
ter.

On other occasions terra cotta 0g-
ures of Isls and Osiris, bought by the
institution for hundreds of pounds,
have been discovered to be composed
of modern clay. oe

A good story is told of a forged sil-
yer cup in Rome that purported to
have come from some secret excava-
tion in‘Sicily. This anclent cup was
ornamented with a circular bas-relief,
representing the frieze of the Parthe-
non. But in the height of his inmo-
cence the forger had given the frieze
in its present ruined condition. The
exhibition’ of the cup was received
with + shouts of laughter. — London

Effect of Bad Tosth.

A paper by a dental surgeon in the
Journal of the American Medical as-
sociation, tells the story of bad teeth
and the effects on thé laboring man's
efficiency. The dentist said ha made
30,000 examinations {n sixteen months
of 17,000 Americans and 13,000 foreign-
ors and foond 96 per cent in need of
dental service. “In 30,000, mouths,”
the dentist sald. “we find 60.000 cavi-
ties and 18,000 extractions necessary,
78,000 in all. If each one causes an
average loss, through waste of time
and cost to repair, of $2 it means a
In New York city
last year 67.000 children failed to be
promoted to higher grades because of
defective teeth, and It costs New York
city $1,087.600 to duplicate a year's
schooling to those who fail”

i Digestibility of Cheese.

By experiments on the digestibility
of cheese it bus hoen shown that much
depends on the special physical char-
acters of the fool. All fat cheeses are
said to be dissolved and digested with
gent rapidity, because the molecules
of cnsein~the nitrogenous part of the

| cheesp—are separated only by the fate

and so the gastric, juice can attack a
large surface of the cheese at one time.”
Whether the cheese be bmrd or soft
does not appesr to influtnce digestion;
and there 18 no connection between the
digestibllity and the percentage of wa-
ter present in the cheese. - :

the boarding houge mistress to the ap-

A WESTERNER'S RECOMMENDATION

By H, Milton Martin,

I have no hesitation In recommending to every one that at
least a portion of his funds be used for the purchase of CAN-
ADA VICTORY WAR LOAN BONDS. Whether ft be $50.00,
$100.00, $1000.00, or more that one has in hand, there is no better
way, in my opinion, of, using this money then fo purchase VIC-
TORY BONDS. 5

Now is the time for all women and men who are dependent
upon thelr savings for their livelihood to loan them to Canada:
snd at the same time help themselves. Many of these have been
unable to assist the various patriotic organizations’ bgeause of
their limited income. Now thoy may INCREASE their income
and help Canada. It [8s not often that.ono can personally benefit
by a patriotic act and surely now that tne occasion presents it-
self, no one should fall to take advantage of it. .

The objective set by the Minister of Finance is $150,000,000.
Many guesses are being made fis to how much more will be sub-
scribed. Let every one help, whether it bo for bonds of small

denomination or large ones. Let every one who fins the power,
purchase at feadt a $50.00 bond and thereby assist in continuing
the unobstructed uge of the High seas, so that the products of
our farms, mines and fastories may bo carried to our boys at
the front; 60 that the farmers may be paid fot thelr grain; so’
that every man employ! miay receive his wages; 80 that Canada
may be maintained In the high esteem of sll the Alties.

Let us show what we think of our” democratic {institutions
by buylug our own bonds, and last bat not least, let us show the
enemy that we.are in this war heart and soul and will be so unfil
