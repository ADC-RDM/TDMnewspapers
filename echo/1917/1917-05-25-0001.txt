John" Sloan, who built this building,

was a very prominent man of this dis-

trict. He was a member of the first |
District Council, composed of Essex,
Kent ‘and Lambton, in 1842-43-44.
When the Municipal Council of the
united counties of Essex and Lambton
| was organized, in 1850, hg was again
reeve, and in 1852 was Warden. When
Essex’ county was organized as a coun-
ty by itself, in 18563, he was Warden,
and also in 1864.

In this connection, a few additional
glimpses into the history of-the sceng
of the Brunner, Mond activities will
be of interest. ‘

Thomas B® White, who owned the
farm and lived In the residence to
the north’ of the Sloan property, which
has also been taken over by the Com-

P. | pany and’ used to house their foreign

element, operated the quarrys which
was in the rear of the Sloan property
for many years. During his term of
ownership théy stone required for the
western end of the construction of
the Canada Southern railway and the
car ferry slips was furnished by Mr.
White, Many of the buildings through-

White gave liberally of his time to
municipal affairs. He was reeve of
Anderdon from 1869 to 1879, from 1581
to 1884, Inclusive, and In 1892-3. He

was also a candidate. for the Proyin-

the rallway crossing was in operation
from Gordon to Stoney Island andi
Grosse Isle. The residence adjoining
the Brunner, Mond property, occupied
by Mr. Mailloux, Township Clerk, was
built by the late Thomas Ouellette,
who was the most extensive hardwood
timber dealer Essex county ever had.
The residence formerly occupied by
the quarry engineer is being remodel-
led into a fiest ald hospital, with Miss
McCaffrey, R. N., in charge. The
houses around the quarry and other
residences on. the property have been
fitted up for employees.

-Anderdon Quarry—is said to’ produce

It is generally admitted that Mr:
