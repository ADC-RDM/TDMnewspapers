After several welks of inspection work In Ontarlo every tobacco growing
section has been cowered in an offort to make the Department of ‘as much
use as possible to ti? tobacco growers,

In this work the condition of the crop and the acreage has been very
closely ascertained.

Last year the spring was late and wet while this spring we experenced

a colder and Miter sping. For this reason the crop had a late start. A great
deal of trouble was had With tobacco seed beds, and many failures were ex-
perienced. Taken as a Whole the semi-hit seed bed gave the best results.
2: There was a ratheb severe outbreak of root-rot in many sections this
year, and shortly after \ransplanting: most of Essex county experienced =»
rather long drought. The drought was later broken by rains that came in
ume todd quite a little god and pull up the total production somewhat,

Labor has been very Jtrd to obtain in growing tobacco this year. No
~ doubt Inbor has limited (he acreage and consequently the production: more
than any other factor this year.

Pelee Island—Cutting or harvesting {5 beginning, The crop promises to
be good in quality. The acreage {8 practically the same as last year, but
the yield will be better. There are about 500 acres of tobacco in the Island,
all devoted to White Burley. The product will be about 650,000 pounds.

Kent County—This coinly shows a slight decrease in acreage. 670 acres
are devoted to tobacco, 100 acres of which is devoted to Zimmer Spanish and
other cigar tobaccos; the remainder {8 devoted to White Burley. The de-
crease In acreage has come mainly on the heavier lands where the last two
Inte springs have made it very difficult to get the tobacco in the fleld at the
proper time. The production for the county will be approximately 700,000
pounds including all varieties.
