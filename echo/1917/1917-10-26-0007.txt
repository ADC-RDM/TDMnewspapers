DON'T MISS THE POINT.

There Is a man in thls pert. of the
world who répresents, to our way of
thinking, a pretty goodsaverage of hu-
man nature. Whenever the preaclier
in_his church delivers a very hot ser-
mon ogainst some special kind of sin,
this man gets enthusiastic and goes
around, to the vestry to téll the preach:
er what a fine sermon it wns. Then
he goes home and repeats it to his
brother, and théy talk over the points
and the people the sermon hit the
hardest. But this partienlar man nev-
or sees when the sermon hits him. ~ *

Early next month the biggest public
campaign ever put on in Canada will
be opened to get subscriptions for the
fourth Canadinn war loan, the Victory
Loan. The thing people In this dls © ©
trict must bear In mind is: ' That the’
appeals are directed"to each and ev-
ery one of them. It {s not merely the
well-off men and women who are being

little sermons which will be “preach.
