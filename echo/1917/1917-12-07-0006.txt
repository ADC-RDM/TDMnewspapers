We are deep-sea sailor folk. We are the men who sail and fight His Majesty’s battleships. We are the men
who go down to the sea in merchant ships. We combat storm and wave—ice-floe, shipwreck and
submarine, that the Empire may not receive its death blow on the High Seas. We do this for
- little wage. We do it without a thought.of our own safety. Nor can we provide for :

into the ‘Beyond—and there is none else to: look after them.
