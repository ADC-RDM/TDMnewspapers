AGKING PROHIBITION
OF BLAUGHTERING OF
ALL YOUNG ANIMALS

 

Essex Production Committes Wants Federal
: Order Made.

In an organized effort to assist In conserv-
ing the food supply of the British Empire, a
Windsor committee recently formed to help
Essex County farmers fncrease food produc.
tion, will recommend to the Dominion Gov-
ernment that an order prohibiting the kill-
ing the lambs, calves and young pigs be
made at once.

The committee estimates that at least one
hundred pounds of meat is lost every time a
jamb {8 slaughtered. The same ratio ap.
plies to calves and milk pigs. Millions of
pounds of meat can thus be saved this sum-
mer in Canada If such an order was made
effective, the committee believes. With
warm weather coming, these Is no necessity
for families using meat every day, a mem-
por of the committee stated. “it is far bet-
ter and more economical to use vegetables
and fruits during the summer months. As
for slaughtering lambs, calves and pigs, that
should be made unlawful, tor {t {8 nothing
less than a luxury to vwsd such meat.”

The committee {8 untnimous about these
recommendations; and will send a deputa.
tion to Ottawa, If necessary, to present the
matter to the Government.

FARMERS WONT PAY $2.00.

The help so badly needed on the farms ia
being withheld In a serious degree, accord-
ing to a statement made by Miss Harvey,
district representative of the labor bureau,
in London, last week. The great difficulty
is the matter of pay, men working In the
city, who have had farming experience, de-

manding $2 a day, ard point out that while -

accepting this they are sacrificing from $1
to'$2 a day. On the other hand the farmers
just as absolutley refuse to pay’ more than
31.50 a day, so that it appears that uniess
the Government takes some action it will be
impossible for the' seeding to be completed
in the proper time. The farmers claim that
it is essential that the seeding should he
completed by the first of May (f the best
crops Are to be reaped, and they claim that
they cannot afford to pay more than $1.50 a
day for a man.

RET AE
SPRING ENTHUSIASM.

The more I sing of gentle spring, the
more J want to carol; these pleasant days I
turn ont lays and anthems by the barrel. As
fresh the earth as when its birth occurred
in distant ages; we shed our years and hop
like steers, or kangaroos In cages, All win
ter long my works were wrong, and grief in
me was reigning; and other jays who went
their ways In anguish were complaining.
1'd walk a mile before & smile I'd see upon
a critter; all men were sore and o'er and
o'er they cussed the winter bitter. But now
1 walk around & Block on legs that wish to
gambol, and fifty styles of cheerful smiles
I witness in my ramble. Spring, sweet and
calm, is nature’s balm for all our ills and afl-
ings: our souls It cheers, and dries our
tears, and shames our idle wailings.
