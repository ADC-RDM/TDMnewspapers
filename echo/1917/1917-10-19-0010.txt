The chief press censor of Canada
sends a warning to Canadian editors
as to how they comment upon the
operation of the Military Service Act ;
Some weekly newspaper editor in the |
west has got himself in hot water Yor |
criticism. The warning is that pub-
lications containing any such objec-!
tionable matter will be prosecuted, and
through the Canadian Press Limited
the papers are asked to pass the warn- |

ing on

The appointment of W..F. O'Connor, |
K.C., a8 Coneral Returning Officer for
the Dominion elections, has been re-
commended to the Cabinet Council, |
and the appointment will undoubted- |
ly be confirmed. Mr. O'Connor will re-
ceive the returns from both Canada
and overseas, which, added together,
will decide the result-in each con-
stituency, The overseas vote taken in
France wiil be counted at the office off
the High Commissioner by properly |
constituted authorities, = The results
will then be cabled to the General Re-
turning officer, who will announce the
final resnplts. In all constituencies
where the result of the home voting
{s reasonably close, the election will |
be in doubt.until the cabled, returns
are received.

The reorganized Canadian Govern:
ment plans to have Canada directly
represented at We ngton, and has
chosen Hon. J. D, Hazen, former Min-
ister of Naval Service and Marine
and Fisheries for the post. At pres-
ent the British Ambassador handles
Canada's diplomatic business. For-
merly communications between Wash-
ington and Ottawa had to go via Lon-
don. Recently the channel of com-
munication has been made. more
direct, but “still through the Brit
fish embassy. Affairs between Canada
and the United Str*cs have so in-
creased in number and importance
since the war began, and éspecially
since the United States entered, that
it is no wproposed to carry out the
long discussed plan of naming a Can-
adian commissioner for Washington.
Mr. Hazen will be associated with the
British ambassador, but yvill have con-
siderable opportunity*for independent
initiative.

Mrs. H. L. Williams Meets Death in
Peculiar Accident at
Leamington.

Mrs. Willlams, wife of H. L. Wil
liams, a prominent fruit farmer living
on the 1st concession of Mersea town-
sihp, was instantly killed shortly be-

~ fore noon on Saturday. She had been

in to Leamington with her husband,
“and when in front 6f her home on re-
turning saw her pet cat lying dead
in the wire fence. She went to get

{t, and on touching the cat fell over |

dead. :
Investigation showed that the high
wind had blown down one of the wires
of thé Edison Electric Power Com:
pany. It/lay across the fence, and as
soon as Mrs. Williams touched the cat
several thousand volts pased through
her.

Her husband while trying to remove
his wife from where she had fallen re-
celved such a powerful shock that he
was knocked down. Experts say that
his escape from instant death was
miraculous.

Mrs. Williams was 34 years old, and
besides her husband is survived by
one son,’ Beter, and one daughter,
Gertie. James Milne, of Chicago, is
a brother. The funeral was held on
Monday afternoon. An inquest will
