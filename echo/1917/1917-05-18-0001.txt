In view of the trouble with the fish

STEEL PLANT AT OJIBWAY.

 

Nine Millions Appropriated for Build-
ings at That Point.

 

A despatch from New York under
date of May 12th says:—'"Thé United
States Steel Corporation has decided
to proceed at once with a Canadian
plant, preparations for which have
been under way for several years.
They have gradually accumulated land
on the water front near Windsor and

laid out several. hundred acres, but
with the outbreak .of the war all
construction plans were suspend-
ad. Present arrangenients call
for an immediate expenditure
of $9,000,000 in the. erection of

buildings and installation of machin-
ery. 5 The directors have voted this
amount, and have approved of un
scheme calling for $10,000,000 to $15, |
000,000 more. While the office here |
would give no details of the depart
mental features of the jmmedinte de-
velopment, there is an impression that
the first unit to be constructed will
be devoted to ship's plates and shapes
which Includes angle “irons,
beams and other odd-agctions,” This
looks authentic. If it {8 there will be

fill the bill for all requirements of a
fish hatchery, and an effort in that
direction cannot be made too soon.

Everyone conversant with the great
good accomplished by means of de-
positing white fish and other species
of fry knows that more fish hatcheries
are required, and Amherstburg, at the
mouth of Detroit River, contiguous to
Boils Blanc, Where a great deal of the
spawn Is gathered, {8s the logical place
for th eestablishment of a fish hatch-
ing.plant. The Department could ens-
ily be induced to locate one here with
our magnificent natural site to offer,
if the matter were properly brought to
its attention.

DEATH OF JOHN WATT.

 

John Watt, ex-Treasurer of Pelee
Island and a prominent resident of
that place for many years, died Tues-
day night at the home of his daugh- |!
ter, Mrs. (Capt.) S. A. McCormick,
Amherstburg, in the 73rd year of his
age. Mr. and Mrs. Watt spent the
winter visiting relatives in Woodstock,
Guelph and’ London, returning to Am-
hersthurg early in April, and went to
Pelee on the firsY trip of the boat, Ap-
ril 5th. As he wns not feeling well,

land, he returned to Amherstburg

Teeter, Pneumonia developed and the
end came very suddenly. In the death

his dealings in after life. Later he:

College, and successively was employ-
6d again In the Bank of Montreal and
the Royal Bank at Fergus. When the
latter falled he became editor of the
British Constitution newspaper pub-

hobby, and he soon guava up Newspa-

The phenomenally large sale of Ford cars is the direct
result of Ford SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION.

Ford satisfaction f8 os ‘universal as the Ford car itself,
Doctots, Inwyers, salesmen, bakers, grocers and farmers

Its low cost appeals to them: Its unusually low upkeep
