CUSTOM

Centuries 580 when yecruiting grow
slack, and the need of mon wis im-
perative, "they formed what were
known us “Press gang crews.” A cap
tain wauld ¢nter & town or village,
got the mayor, magisteate end o few
other officials together, then proceed
something like this:

“I'd like to get about a dozen of
able-bodied men here,” begins the cap-
tain.

“Very good,” responds the Mayor,
“we've somo we can spare. Now there's
Bob Skates, able-bodied, but won't
work more'n an average of two days
a week. Put hm down, Then Jack
Spratt beats his wite. Give hing some
ren) fizhting.”

“Don't forget Red Mathers comn-
tihues the Magistrate, “he's up betye
me every few days for fighting.”

“And Scad Smith," chimes in a cop.
“he drinks his eargings, and wite feeds
him.’ And Tobe Stubs depends mostly
on stealing for his ving.”

Thus they would go on till the draft
was made up, then round up the men.

Now If those In both city and coun-
try were rounded up, it has been es-
timated that we could supply quite an
army cof such undesirables. In the
cities and towns are loafers, gamblers,
drunkards, crooks, and those who ne-
gloct, abuse or desert thelr families.
In the country the most common un-
desirables are thieves. Many through
shittlessness, {dieness, extravagance,
or bad management neglect to provide
for the winter. These must have fuel
and food for themselves, also, they
usually have live stock which must
starve or be fed. Their usual way is to
go about stealing ralls, grain, poul-
try, pitted vegetables, or aaything
within reach.

The ones wha do thls thieving are
well known: to those who are robbed,
but It 1s a 4i0endt matter to prove in
many cases, But if a petition is sent
in to the Government to remove these
undesirables, the names of all suspects
could be handed to the military tri-
bunafs, who would gather them into a
unit and pack them off for overseas
gervice.

Of course most of them are gun-shy.
They would be no use in the firing
line, auless to stop  hudels. They
could he used, howevar, in. constris
tion work just behind the lines, but In
the danger zone. There needn't bo
any ago limit. A person old enough,
or not too old to go out stealing, or
otherwise breaking the law, 8 able to
handle a shovel, ar at least rustle
grub for the others, What if a shell
should explode among them, or a show-
er of bullets comé-thelr way? We'd
bear the loss with Spartan enduranese
and resignition. The petition will
probably be irgely eigned —Elizabeth
