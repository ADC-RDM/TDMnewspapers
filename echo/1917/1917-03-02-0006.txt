The Ontario Sheep Breeders’ Asso-
ciation, realizing that owing to the
lack of a central depot where the wool
of its members could be properly
graded and: prepared for the market,
it was not getting as high a price
as the growers of other provinces, has
decided to establish such a depot at
Guelph. It will utilize the entire poul-
try department of the Winter Falr
bulldings. R. W. Wade, secretary of
the association, stated that ‘the wool
would be shipped to Guelph from all
parts of the province, between May
15th and June 10th, It wil be properly
cared for and stored, and after it has
all been received, experts will be sent
there, under the direction of the Dos
minion Live Stock Branmeh of the De-
partment of Agriculture, and they will
proceed to grade the wool ready for
the market. Expert clerks will also
be provided, the wool will be welghed,
and the names of the owners placed

upon It.

( cosT OF BAD ROADS.

]
/ (Amgrican Lumberman.)
A company In,’ Stanislaus county,

 

t| California, that buys skimmed milk

from the farmer, has demonstrated to
the rural residents in an empratic' man-
ner the value of good roads to them.
This company sends trueks directly to
the farms to collect the skimmed milk
but it pays higher prices to farmers
living on good road® than ony bad
roads, On poor .ronds the company

pays 17% cents per 100 pounds, but on’

goodironds it pays 20 cents. Of course
the farmer always has Sheen paying
this tax on every hundréd pounds he
houled over bad roads and he has
been relieved of it on every hundred
pounds lie had hauled over good roads,
but that fact has mot been brought to
his notice as in the ense cited. When
he measures. his distance from town
in minutes instead of miles he will
realize the profit of good roads.

EPIDEMIC WAS SERIOUS,

 

The epidemic "of measles that
raged throughout Ontario for the
larger part of last year proved to be
the most severe known In the pro-
vince since the compilation of - re-

 

cords wns commenced. ‘In an aver-|

age year there are from 4,000.10"5,000
enxes of measles, but during 1916
22,000 cases and 227 deaths were re-

fatal disease, 66 per cent. of the cones
reported ending fatally.

The report was adopted,

Councillor Cenike moved and Mr,
Turner seconded, that the Fire, Water
and Light Committee be empowered
to get quotations from local dealers
for coats, hats and boots for the town
firemen. a 4,

Mr. Allen abjected to going to ‘this
expense. The firemen had got along
without these clothes for _gseveral
yours. :

Mr. Sutton belleved in dealing gen-
erously with gur firemen. They spoil
good suits of their own clothing: by
not having waterproofs.

Mr. Cralg—"In case of n fire do
they go home and get on their suits;
or do they go us they aro?”

Reeve Brown thought there should
be an locker on each eart, or some way
of leaving the sults handy.

Mr. Crimmins said that when he was
a fireman they got suits, but objected
to them being labelled. ‘He wore his
out for other purposes. He didn’t
think that the town could stand this
expense, but if they were labelled ‘with
big yellow, letters; «the owners would
not wear them In their priyate busi-
ness,

Mr. Denlke and Mr, Turner cham-
pioned the cnuse of the firemen, who
could make their own regulations re
the suits. It ansn't fair for" them to
wear out a $30 or $40 suit at a fire.

Mr. Crimmins—*They shouldn't wear
that mnch clothes at a fire,”

Mr. Cralg—“1 was a flreman for].

ten years.afil wore out my fireman's
coat working In the mill"

After further discussion, as (t was
only giving the committee authority
to procure prices, the motfon was car-
ried.

Mr. Crafg—"Has the S., W, &’A. Ry
been notified fn regard to moving thefr
track?" v

Reeve Brown—*"I rather think Mr.
Haugh wrote them. There v a mo-
tion authorizing him to do so.”

Several members spoke on the ques-
tion, ‘urging haste.

The Clerk read the motion passed
last August dealing with this matter,

Mr. Allen urged a renotification,
and that the council intended starting
paving at the Pike, ~

Moved by Messrs. Sutton and Den-
ike, that the Clerk be authorized to
notify the manager of the S., W. & A.
electric railway that the council in-
tends paving from North street, od
Sandwich street, and to move their
tracks to the ‘center of the street,—
Carried. . em

Moved by Mr. Craig, seconded by
Mr. Sufton, that he also be notified
that the council intend paving Apsley
and Sandwich street, from )Gore to
North street, and that the Company be
requested to move their tracks from
North street to the northern limits of
town,

Mr. D@énike objected to Including
this part for paving. The other would
be of great advantage to the town.
wThe motion carried.

“Mr. Sutton voiced a complaint of
the trees being too close on Br ck
street, causing a good deal of damp-
nees. He moved that the matter of
cutting every other tree out be left to
the Board of Works. This was sec-
onded by Mr, Denike and carried.

The matter of pruning trees at Rose
Hill cemetery and putting up a_ rail.
ing was also talked over, but no ac-
tion taken. > * ;

Moved by Mr. Denike, that the C. 0,
P. be instructed to go around and col-
lect the cigarette by-law -fees.—This
motion was withdrawn and the Police

Committee undertook to see the work
was 2 by the C, 0. P. cod

Moved by Mr. Denike, that the junk
dealers have a license of $25 this
year. After discusgion-lhe gaye notice
of a by-law to this effect.

the council, asking the remson why
