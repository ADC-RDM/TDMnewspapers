IRRITATED |
& SORE ?

There is something in Zam-Buk
that makes this famous balm vic-
torious over obstinate skin diseasen.

Mr. John L. Frenette, of Niga-
doo, N.B,, writes: “* A rash appeared
on my head and quickly spread until
my head was entiraly coverad with
sores. 1 was a shocking sight, and
was suffering a great deal with thr
burning and {rritation. I consylted
a doctor, who told me I had eczema,
and although he prescribed severa'
medicines which 1 used, I did nol
seem to get any better.

“Then I tried Zam-Buk, which *
had heard highly recommended, an?
was soon delighted with the im
provement in the sores. The burn
ing and irritation got less by de
grees, and then disappeared. The
inflammation was drawn out, and
before long the sores were entirely
healed.” ae ol
Zam-Buk is the world'a great her |
dal skin cure, and Is unequalled for
ulcers, old sores, bad legs, boil
blood-poironing, ringworm, and
piles, as well as cuts, burns, scalds,
and all gkin injuries. “All druggists |

$100 a mile to Wo (ese rond beds, and then the
work Is only half done, as the smaller weeds are
overlooked, and theye goon sprout and the road-
bed is as bad as ever pg very short time.
