~—Themécessity of testing Seed oats
4s-Pearly demonstrated by a test a
farmer in this vicinity recently made.
He had a considerable quantity of
oats left over from the crop of 1915,
from which he took his seed in the
spring of 1916. The oats appeared to
bein good condition, but He decided to
make a. test of two hundred grains,
These were put in a pan of earth and
kept in a warm place, and to his ut-
ter astonishment only 54 grains ger-
minated out of the 200. Any ane can
figure out what it would have meant
had he sown this grain: when only 27
per cent. had sufficient viwality to ger-
milpate. It peid this farmer to make
hls test, and it will pay others too.

SAVING RASPBERRIES.

Cultivation in Late Fall and Early
Spring Kills Worms.

Wormy raspberries, still fresh in the
minds of ‘the pickers, are fortunately
not a pecessary evil Berries which
are fnfested with raspberry fruit
worms cannot be shipped any dis-
tance. They make the box unsightly,
soon fall apart and require unneces-
sary work of the housewife.

During the picking season and’ im
mediately after the season's close the
wofms drop to the zroumd, where after
about six weeks they change to belp-
less, delicate pupae. In the spring they
transform to small adult,” brownish
beetles’ about oni-seventh of an inch
long. Being bunzrr. they immediately
chew elongated holes in the young,
tender leaves and later make holes im
the buds. Often from 10 to 15 per
cent of the bods may be destroyed in
this manner.

Sine the insects are helpless in the
Zround, cultivation in the late fali and

Covered Yards Save Manure.

nell, was a strong advocate of covered
barmyards for the conservation. of
manure. This system fs advocated by!
Professor Frazier of the University of
Illingls. - Covered barnyards are sheds

: with zood roofs, with or without sides
{ and large enough fo allow the cattle {3

move about freely. The bottom Is
paddled clay or cement. The manure
removed (rom the bagy is spread

‘about and Sufficient bedding distrib

uted over the surface to insure clean-”
liness.

The animals tramp the accomulat-
ing manure into a’ compact mass and
Leep it moist by their liquid excre-
ment. This assures an excellent ms-
nore, with. but slight losses of plant
food. Yn addition it affords exercise
and a bealthy environment for the ani-
mals in‘severe weather. The plan has
been tried by many dairymen and is
generally considered satisfactory. It
is said that the cows keep cleaner than
when stabled. and tie milking barn is
more sanitary, *
