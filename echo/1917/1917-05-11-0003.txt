 THE'LOVE OF OATS

‘Why Normal, Active People Ak
4 Crave Oatmesl ye

Oats contain more body-building food than
any other grain that grows. They contain
more energy-giving food. You know their |
effect on horses.

Oats contain more organic phosphorus
than any other grain, and phosphorus is the
brain's ‘main constituent. They contain
more lecithin, and lecithin isythe chief
component of the entire nervousisystem.

That's why workers love oatmeal. That's
why growing children crave it. 1tis simply.
the eall of nature for what bodies, brains
and nerves require.

But some oatmeal fails to meet these
requirements, Only the richest, piumpest
oats supply afood worth while. The cholc-
est oats are sifted 62 times to get the
grainsifor Quaker Oats. Only ten pounds
are gecured from a bushel, But these-fine
oats, when prepared by the Quaker proc-
ess, supply the utmost in oatmeal,

Oatmeal is the most important food I
serve. And the best costs only one-half
cent per dish. | Don't supply your table
with inferidr oats.

{ The Ragged
Boy

An Easter Story

 

 

By ETHEL HOLMES

Beddoes dob dob lob blob bb bbb ebb

One Baster Sunday morning a girl
about twelve years old sallied forth
from a spick and span farmhouse to
go to Sunday school, On the way she
overtook a.boy about her own age
whose forlorn appearance touched her
beart. He was out at the elbows, out
at the knees of his trousers, and his
toes appeared between the upper part
of his shoes and the soles. The ex-
pression on his faco was in accord
with his apparel—it was one of misery,

“Aren't you golng to Sunday school
asked the girl

“Sunday school!” the boy repeated.
as though he had not heard aright. *

“Yes, THis is Easter Sunday. Didn't
you know that all the children go to
Sunday school and all the grownups go
to church?’

The boy looked at the girl's clothes,
then at his own. She was a picture of
neatness, he a picture of poverty.

“1 couldn't go to Sunday school look- |

ing this way, could I?” he said.
The girl looked doubtful. Then sud-
denly an idea seemed to como to her.

“If you did,” she sald, “they would |

all look at you as if they were afraid

 

you'd touch them. Come with me. |

111 show them that you're a friend of
mine.”

~ The boy demurred, and the girl in- |

glgted. She took him with her to Sun-
day school, but she could not get him
forward among the other children. He
took a back seat, whero he was not no-
ticed. © But the girl sat beside him.
There was an open window near them,
and a draft was coming in on them.
The boy shivered, and tho girl took
off her coat and put it over his shoul-
ders,

During the exercises a collection was
taken up, One of the boys passed the
plato to where these two were sitting,
but the girl made no move to put in a
contribution. Of course her friend,
the ragged boy, had nothing to give,
but the boy who was taking up the
collection wondered, for the girl was
the daughter of the richest farmer
thercabout and was a liberal giver.
That Mary Treusdall gave no Easter
offering was indeed a surprise

When the services were over Mary
and her protege went: out together,
and he insisted on hurrying away be-
fore the others could get a view of his
dilapidated condition. When they came
to a fork in the road and no one was
near Mary took a five dollar pill from
her pocket.

‘This was to have been my Easter
offering at Sunday school. But, you
see, I couldn't give so much when you
hed nothing to give. It would have
made you feel ashamed. So I thought
I'd keep it for an Easter offering for
you.” A

He' drew back. There was that in
him which had led him to appreciate
her delicacy in avolding hurting his
feelings, and it was this same appre-
ciation that Jed him to decline her gift.
She understood at once. 5

“Take it as a loan,” she said. “Some
day a small amount Uke this will be
nothing to you and you can repay me.”

There was a hopeless look on the
boy's face, a shamed look, as he per-
mitfed her to thrust the bill upon him,
He sald nothing, but his. eyes spoke
volumes. She took his hand in bers,
pressed it, then turned to go to her
home, he following her wistfully with
his sad eyes. ) !

This was the first kindness that he
bad recelved from a stranger, a kind-
"ness shown him by one near his own
age. He stood, occasionally dropping
his eyes to the bill in his hand, then
raising them to the retreating figure
of the girl who had given it to him.
Then came a great change in him. He
had received an incentive. It seemed
to him that an angel had been sent
from heaven to lift him out of the
slough of despond. A resolution came
to him to be worthy of the donor.
With, the encouragement he bad re-
ceived it seemed to him that.be could
move the world.

| Now York. A distant bell told him
that a service was about to take place

 

 

In the chur€h, and ho strolled forth In
that direction. Childreh were strag-
gling Iuto the gulld rogm for Sunday
school, Sanford saw a woman cmerge
from the Treusdall farmhouse nnd go
townrd the church. She entered ft,
nnd Sanford followed her iu, taking a
back geat. The woman went up on te
a dais and conducted the school
Something about her convinced San-
ford that she was the girl who had
made him an Easter lonn. There was
enough of the child left in her to de-
note this, and there was unmistakable
evidence in her munner.”

Sanford remained in his sent while
the school was in session, and when a
collector cnme to him for his Easter
offering be folded a $100 bill in a bit
of paper, on which he wrote in pencil,
“Principal and interest of an Easter
offering that should bave been made
ten years ago.”

The contributions were handed to
Mary Treusdall, but what became of
them Sanford did not know. He left
the place with the children and stroll-
ed about near by till he saw Mary
emerge. She was moving in the df
rection of her home on the hill when
he joined her,

“Pardon me,” he sald; “I am a stran-
ger here. Perhaps you can give me
some information that I need.”

She turned her eyes upon him. If
he had had any doubt of her identity
it was dispelled. There was the same
kindly, honest look In them ho had
seen as a boy and which had -con-
tributed to change him from a ragged
boy to a prosperous man.

“Phat farm,” he continued, pointing
to the hilltop—‘‘why is it not prosper-
ous? Is there anything the matter
with the soll?"

“Nothing, My father, who formerly
owned it, had a succession of bad
years on account of the weather. He
left the property fo me encumbered,
and it has since been all 1 could do to
pay the interest on the mortgage.”

“L am an {investor in farm mort.
gages,” sald Sanford. “What interest
do you pay?’

“Six per cent.”

“Indeed, I find it dificult to loan at
5. How much is the mortgage?”

“Five thousand dollars, but there is
also an accumulation of interest, which
brings the total up to something like
sixty-six hundred.”

By this time they had reached the
farm, and Sanford paused.

“Since you are a stranger here,” said
Mary, “I should be pleased to have
you dine with us.”

‘Sanford accepted the invitation. The
family consisted of an aunt of Mary's
and .a younger sglster, in whom the
guest saw a duplicate of the girl who
had befriended the ragged boy. After
dinner he mnde an inspection of sthe
farm, or pretended to inspect it, and
when he returned to the house asked
Mary. if she could give him the amount
of the principal and interest due on
the mortgage. She did so. amd he said
to her:

“I will consider it a favor if you will
allow me to add this to my other
loans.”

Mary was puzzled. She was not
aware that the loan was especially de-
sirable as: an investment. However,
flocs’ the stranger asked as a favor
what would be an advintage to her
she assented. As soon as she had

| done so Sanford whipped out a pocket

checkbook and wrote her a check for
the amount, telling her that the papers
in the case could be executed the next
day.

Sanford. did not seem inclined to
hurry away, and the afternoon was
well spent before he made a move to
depart. Then Mary said that, being a
stranger in a strange ‘land, he had

better take tea with them, and this in- |

vitation, too, was accepted. During
the evening he and Mary were sitting
together before a little blazo on the
hearth, for the nights were still cool,
when she suddenly said to him:

“Did you put that hundred dollar bill

.| in the Easter offering at Sunday school

this morning 7”

“I dia.”

“What did you mean by what you
wrote on: the wrapper?”

“Ten years ago today a little girl,
the daughter of a prosperous farmer,
met a ragged boy on the road, took
him to Sunday school and afterward
loaned -bim the amount she was to
have given for an Easter offering. You
are that farmer's daughter, and I am
that ragged boy.”

 

 
 
    
   
 
     
       
       
    
     

Business “Men and Breadwinners

the Victims of Nervous
Exhaustion.

 

When worry Is added to overwork
men soon become the victims of ner-
vous exhaustion—ncurasthenin —the
doctor calls it. Some hove no reserve
strength In thelr systems to bear the
strain; others overtax what strength
they have. If you find that you are
nervous and not sure of yourself, that
you sleep badly, and wake up tired and
aching, your nerves are out of order.
Other signs are inability to take prop-
er interest in your work; your appe-
tite Is fickle; your back feels weak,
and you are greatly depressed {n spir-
{ta. One or more of these signs mean
that you should take prompt steps to
stop mischief by nourishing the nerves
with the blood they thrive on, namely,
the rich, rod blood made by Dr. Wil-
litms' Pink Pills, These pills hyve
cured thousands of cases of nervous
disorders, including nervous prostra-
tion, nturalgin, St. Vitus dance and
partial paralysis. Here is an example.
P. H. Callan, a well known business
man in Cgleman, P. E. I, says:—"1
owe, my present health. if not life
ftself, to Dr. Willlams' Pink Pills. I
had always been an active man, and
when I began to run down, in health
paid little attention to it as I thought
it only a temporary weakness, As
time passed, however, 1 found myself
growing worse, and consulted a doctor,
who said that I was not only. badly
run down, but that my nervous sys-
tem was badly shattered. I lost flesh,
my appetite was poor, | slept badly
and notwithstanding the doctor's treat-
ment grew so weak that 1 had to leave
my business and was confined to the
house. Time went on and I was stead-
ily growing weaker, and my friends
were all greatly alarmed for my con-
dition, In this condition 1 was strong-
ly recommended to try Dr, Willlams’
Pink Pills, and’'as the doctor's medi-
cine was not helping me I decided to
do so. By the time 1 had used three
boxes I could tell that they were help-
ing me. When I had taken eight box:
es of the pills I felt able to attend to
my business again, and pCople were
surprised to see me out, I continued
the use of the pills until I had taken
twelve boxes, by which time TI; was
feeling as well as ever 1 did, and was
being congratulated by all my friends
on my full restoration to health, . I
feel now that If 1 had used Dr. Wil.
llams’ Pink Pills at the outset I would
not only have saved: much money
spent In doctor's bills, but would have
had renewed health sooner. 1 cannot

speak too highly of this medicine, and'[

would recommend it to every man who
feels weak, nervous or run down.”

You can get these pills through any
medicine dealer, or by mail at 50 cents
n box, ar. siX boxes for $2.50 from The
Dr. Willlams' Medicine Co., Brock:
