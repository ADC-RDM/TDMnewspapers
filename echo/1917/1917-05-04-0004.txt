GATHER UP THE FRAGMENTS.

Last year thousands &f bushels of
apples rotted in the orchirds of Michi-
gan and the middle wsstern stites.
This was no new thing it had hap-
pened year after year before that.
Some of the neglected apples were
scrubby ond poor and sore were not
so negligible. « Some of them were left
to decpy as of liftle worth; others
were allowed to waste because there
were nore to gather thera up, But
1917 is a differént ycor. Every runty.
scrubby apple Is of value this year.
To let any go to waste will nat only
be a shame/nnd a disgrace but it will
be inhuman and unpatriotic in view of
the cries for food coming from a hun
gry world.

Gather up the scrub apples and re-
vive the almost-forgotten home Indus:
try of drying apples over the kitchen
fire this autumn, If the apples-are
too poor for this, can them; {f they
aren't eyen good enough for this pur-
pose,
help fatten the pigs and sweeten the
park.

And what is done with the
matter should be done with everything
else that is eatablez “Gather up the
fragments that nothing be lost."—De-
