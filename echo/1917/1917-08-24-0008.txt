—The river front in the vicinity of
the waterworks was the scen@ of great
commotion on Saturday night about
10 o'clock when two young men from
Detroit,” cropding -to Boils Blanc in a
éanoe unwittingly ran into a towline
which threw one of them into the
water, upset the canoe. with the other
occupant, and both would have gone
to n watery grave but for the prompt
action of a couple of Amherstburg
citizens; one of “whom at least risked
his life in saving one of the boys
from perishing. The young men were
Kroner, of Port Huron, and Batchelor,
of Oregon, employed in a Detroit fac-
tory. - They came to Amherstburg by
canoouthat afternoon, remained around
town umtil nearly 10, then struck
across the river to spend the night in
a mutual friend's cottage at Bolg
Blanc point. Being unacquainted with
the lower Detroit river, they didn't un-
derstand by the lights that an upbound
tug was followed by two barges, and
paddled into the tow line, which
catching Batchelor under: the chin
threw him out, and the canoe relieved
of his weight capsized with Kroner,
who couldn't swim, but had presence
of mind enough to grasp the steel
cable, but his cries for help caused
the tug tq stop and the slackening of
the line carried the young man under.
‘Catlikg the hauled himself along to-
the barge, and soonsfound himself out
of water; and taking a death like grip
remainéd there ‘suspended.’ In the
imoantime his companion, Batchelor,
who was an; expert swimmer, struck
out for Bois Blane, but impeded by
‘hig clothing and darkness soon found

the excursion only. Finzel's full or-
