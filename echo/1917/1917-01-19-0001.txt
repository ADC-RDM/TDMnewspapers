The evangelistic services being held
in the town hall are increasing in in-
terest and attendance daily. The Rey. |
Mr. Johnston i8 a forceful and stfr- |

ring speaker and is fully up to expec- |

tations, On Sunday evening ho spoke
on the various hindrances to the
Christian life; on Tuesday evening on
“The Home", and on Wednesday even:
Ing his subject was “His Majesty the |
Devil.” ‘Mr. Johnston sustains the in-
terest of his audience throughout, and |
drives home the lessons with irrsist- |
able force, « The choir has now en-!

 

rolled 160 members with an average
attendance of 100. Mr. Moon is a
skillful choir leader, and apart from |
anything else the training which the |

ite value to them. The service of |

gether with the music, may he obtain- |
ed from theushers nny evening exeapt
cept Sunday, at 20c and 30e. Inserted |
in each song book is a copy of the
Litany and the Te Deum and Bene-|
dictus. The Te Deum, wliich is said
to be the greatest hymn of Thanks.
giving in the English language, is now
being used, and no doubt at the end of
the meetings when the results are
evident it will fittingly describe the
feelings of the people. A service for
Bible reading and prayer is now being
hald each morning between 9.30 and
10 o'clock at some down town business
