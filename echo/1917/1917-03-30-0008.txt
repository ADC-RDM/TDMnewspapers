AFFECTED BY THE WAR

 

Acid Phosphate Cheapest This Spring |

|
Owing to the high prices ot ferti-

lizers due to the European War, the
Ohio Experiment Station Is warning
farmers not to buy complete fertilizers
or any carriers of nitrogen and potas-
sium for their spring crops. Acid
phosphate in:experimental tests cov-

| ering more than 20 years has proved
|the cheapest and most. effective ferthl-
{izer for this state,

Carriers’ of nitrogen ares especially

high this year, and this element has |

seldom returded its cost on corn and
oats at the Experiment Station and its
various substations scattered over the
State. Where clover i8 grown: and

manure [8 properly applied nitrogen is |

unnecessary, according to'soll experts.

All fertilizers containing potassium,
‘which come from Germany, are so
high In price this year that their use
18 not recommended.

While a/fertilizer containing nitro-
gon, phosphorus and poatssium has re-
turned $15.78 net profit when used at
the rate of 1,070 pounds per gcre in
five years In a rotation of corn, oats,
wheat, clover and timothy at Woaster,
320 pounds of acid phosphate alone has

   
  
  
  

20 years. In other words, 100 pounds
of acid phosphate has been worth
nedrly three times as ‘much in net re-
sults as the same amount of complete
fertilizer.
