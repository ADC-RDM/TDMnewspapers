A new ruling on the Ontario Tem-
perance Act was handed down by
Magistrate Kingsford in the Toronto
Police court last week and provides
that even horses may not partake of
liquor, Lesley Williamson was charg-
ed with a violation of the act in .that
he had n bottle of liquor in his buggy
on Queen street west. He pleaded that
the Nquor had been prescribed by a
veterinary for his horse, but some
doubt was cast uponthe truth of this
assertion by the fact that Williamson
had a companion with him, and' that
the companion had attained that nd.
