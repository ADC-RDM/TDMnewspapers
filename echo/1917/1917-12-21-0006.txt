YOUNG FRIENDS:—Victery Loan Bonds are both Patriotic and Pro-
fitable and the public wero anxious to jnvest in them, but now that
the canvass is completed, we would draw your attention to a course,
at our school, the results of which would be to bring you 100, to 200,
to 600 per cent. on your investment, as thousands of our former stu-
dents can testify.

The demands for oMce help the next six months will be greater
than we can possibly supply, so YOU should register with us in Janu-
ary for a real practical training. Notwithstanding the fact that we
have NO SOLICITORS out, we have the Best and the Strongest Class
of all years, some 85 in the Shorthand and Typewriting department,
and January should increase our present atfendance ai jenst 50 pe
cent. Business college and their courses differ widely. but we allow
po other school to surpass us fp Teachers, Baulpment and Courses,
Our Senlor Book-kveping Course is conducted with Currency and Mer-
.chandise {cards), also Bank, Frelght, Wholesale and Retall offices,
which sre. managed by the Seniors, with whom the Juniors do all
kinds of businesi; this-we call our Busy Bee department, and you
would enjoy watching this class.

ness paper, in fact {t is a Minfature Business World,
