in the preceding half month.

Major Balfour, officer commanding
the Amherstburg Recruiting Depot, led
the list with the magnificent total of
154 men. The London mobilization cen-
tre, in charge of Capt. Irvine, was next
with 26, and the Guelph Recruiting De-
pot obtained 23 men. These men were
allotted to whatever units they prefer-
red throughout the district; Of the re-
cruits obtained by the individun) ef-
forts of the units themselves, the En-
gingers secured 24 men, the 63rd Bat-
tery 20 men, and the 64th Battery at
Guelph got 17 men.

While the figures are considered
quite craditable, the fact that the larg»
ost number were obtained at the bor-
der, would geenr to indicate that a
large percentage of them are residents
