THROA
SORE 2

Don't neglect It because yon
think it Is “only a sore throat!"
It is often the beginning of serious
trouble, which can be avoided if

proper © precautions are taken.
Peps will safeguard you.
“Sore throat” is asign that

your power of resistance has been
temporarily lowered, and your
system Is therefore unable to
withstand the atfacks of harmful
germs which are being constant-
ly breathed in. The germs have,
therefore, settled in your throat
and caused inflammation, and to
prevent more serious trouble
these germs must be destroyed.

A Peps pastille dissolved on the
tongue throws off Pine vapor,
which Is as certain a germ-de-
stroyer as the Pine laden air of
the Swiss Mountains, which doc-
tors so highly recommend. These
Pine fumes arc breathed down
into the air passages and lungs,
soothing and healing the inflamed
membranes that medicine swal-
lowed into the stomach could not
possibly reach.

Nothing can equal this bredthe.’

able remedy for all affections of
the throat and lungs, coughs,
colds, hoarseness, asthma, bron-
chitis, ete. All dealers or Peps

ible for the deaths of more children,
especiplly very young ones, than any
other infectious disease, was the
statement mndo by Dr. HAW. Hill,
medical officer of health, London, at
a meoting of the hoard of health last
week. The discussion arose over an
item in Dr. HIIl's report for the month
of Septembbr, showing that three chil-
dren succumbed to whooping cough.
Chairman C, R. Somerville thought the
number run unusually high. Dr. Hill de-
clared that few parents roalize the ser-
lousness of whooping <ough. Death,
he sald, is caused by exhaustion and
lack of nourishment in those suffering
from the disaase.
~It will be remembered that Miss
Kate Tobin, former G. N. W. telegraph
operator at Amherstburg, was called
to her home at Westport on account
of her sister's fllness. A recent {ssue
of the Mirror, published at that place,
contains a very sympathetic account
of her death, which occurred on Sep-
tember 24th. In part is says: “Deep
sorrow and regret were experienced
by all who knew Eulalia Tobin, when
the message of her death was heard on
Monday morinng, September 24th. It
was not known even to her family that
she had been around as usual and feel-
Ing quite well. After going to bed she
sank rapidly. Eulalin was a young
girl, leaving school but a year ago.
In March she entered Water street hos-
pital and by her genial disposition
and kindly. -manner won a host of
friends. Owing to ill health she was
forced to; return home ‘in June from
nursing, she recovered and was about
to continue the calling she thought
noble, when she was seized with men-
Ingitis,”
