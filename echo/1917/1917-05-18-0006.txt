“Fruit-a-tives Again Proves Its
Extraordinary Powers

Rocmox, Que., March 2nd, 1915.
“T have received the most wonderful
benefit from taking *‘ Fruit-a-tives™.
I suffered for years from fkecumalism
and change of life, and I took every
remedy obtainable without results. I
tried ‘ Fruit-a-tives” and it was the
only medicine thatoreally did me good.
Now I am entirely well—the Rhen-
matism has disappeared, and the ter-
rible pafns in my body arc all gone. I
hope at others, who suffer from such
distressing diseases, will try “Fruit-a-
tives’. Mabank ISAIE ROCHON.

some very estimable people who can-
not understand why a newspaper
should not give free space to every
entertainment which is held for
patriotic, benevolent or a religious
purposes, and they are apt to think
even if they do not always say very
mean things when thelr requests have
to be refused. This misconception is
due to a very prevalent belief that
newspaper space costs nothing, and to
a failure to realize that advertising is
almost the sole source of revenue of
the publisher. There {8 no more rea-
son - why) the publisher should give
away his goods, even for a worthy
cause, than a hardware merchant or
a grocer, His space should be. dealt
with oh a business basis, and he

fers, and not have others make them

GO AHE
: COUNTRY WILL FOLLOW

All Along It has Been Assumed that
Quebec Would Not Stand for This
and That—Canada Should Find
Out—The Time Has Come for a
Show-Down.

At Col. Blondin's recruiting meeting
in Montreal on Monday night disturb-
ers were present, and all the speakers,
whether Nationalists, Conservatives,
or Libernls, were interrupted and un:
able to continue. All reports agree
that the whole trouble was caused by
“a few men,” a “small minority.” One
Montreal newspaper says the inter
rupters were “ungracious”; another
gays they were not sober. One young
man in the gallery arose and soid the
Laval students were orderly and were
not making the trouble, but he sup-
posed the newspapers of Ontario
would put the blame on them. There
were references to Ontario and the
school question.

Probably the meeting would have
been an orderly one if a little efficient
police work had been done when the
spirit of disturbance first began to
show {tself. But the opportunity was |
let pass. If the row was made by a
small minority it is unfortunate that

a few should be permitted to misre-
present thé many, and It Is worth |

bec? sAre the people of that Province
alone among free and democratic peo-
ples the whole world over at this time?
We do not believe it, but if it be true,
then the fact ought to be known. But
the word of irresponsible
l

should not be taken in such a matter,
nor should Quebec be judged by the
mniority that interrupts’ a meeting,
nor by unfair critics in other Pro-
vinces who devote their lives to find-
ing fault with fier. Quebec should be
judged- by what she does when the
Government of Caneda takes courage
to place before her and all the Pro-
vinces equally a common duty to per-
form.

What Quebec's Claim Is.

We have before usa pamphlet pub-
lisHed by. La Presse of Montreal, in
which .at ample length and with an
array’ of figures, the publishers claim
they give proof that the.mative-born
sons of Quebec’ .liave, according to
population, enlisted ns promptly and
as numarously in this war as have the
native-born sons of Ontario. Perhaps |
they believe this in Quebec. Its evl- |
dent that La Presse bclleves it-and
thinks the proof is in the pamper, |
Perhaps they believe dn Quebec that
nos many, of their sons as of ours are
already Tn the fighting front in France,
and that Ontario's good showing, aw
compared with Quebec's, is due«to the

tarjo at the. time the war began.

They affirm thfs, and evidently be:
lieve ti, and if they do they would,
perhaps, be: as ready as the people
of Ontario to accept the selective
draft systém for raising. on a fair and
equitable basis, such fdrther forces as
are required to keep the Canadian
army ot the front in nghting strength, |
go that-this country. will not have to
withdraw from the part she has un-
dertaken in the conflict. .

Have We a Country Here or Not?
. Instead ‘of taking the word of timid
politicians as to what Quebec will or,
will*not stand, for, the Government
ought to. take every war measure that
necessity demands, and do so assum-
ing that the people of Quebec have as
much good-will to the cause of France
and the allies as the people of ell the
other Provinces. There is blundering
In any other course. There is no other
way to find out whether we have got
n country here, or only a series af
settlements, X

And, while we are speaking of a
selective draft. let us repeat thet Can-
ada needs a Government formed by
selective draft of the ablest men to
be found in the country, rerardless of
politics. Such a Government, instead
of whispering and head-shaking about
Quebec maligned, or are her people,
measures, rouse Parliament out of (ts
present nightmare of (dleness to deal
with matters worth while, and put up
to the whole country, Quebec included,
the duties that belong to these days.
Then wo shall see what we shall see,

PRESERVE FIELD PRODUCTS
FROM LOSS BL FIRE

Empire's Call is for Greater
“Production.”—It is Equally Im-
portant to “Preserve” our Pro-
ducts From Loss by Fire.

The fire waste of the Province of
Ontario for the first three months of
1917, as shawn by reports to the Fire
Marshal, amounts to $3,321,931. In
1916 it amountediic round figures to
$12,000,000, and if the waste is not
stopped, the year 1917 (threatens to
be as disastrous as {ts predecessor.

The unfortunate part of.the whole
matter is that the waste comes largely
from the destruction of field products
fn barns, elevators and, warehouses, or
in canning factories, cereal mills and
other places wliere the raw produce is
being turned into food for our own
nedds or for the armies of the Allies.

It is equally true that many fires,
probably one-half of them, could be
avoided by a little care and thought.
Surely, as no people we should be
ready and willing to take up this Em-
pire call and preserve what we’ pro-
duce. 7

By way. of example reference’ {s
made to barn fires. Last year in On-
tario alone over 600 barns were” de-
stroyed involving a loss of more than

we should be doing the equivalent of
that much extra, production and who
is there among us who is not prepared
to do his ubit? on this line?

Three very simple suggestions are
thrown out which if adopted will go a
long way tommecomplish the result: —
