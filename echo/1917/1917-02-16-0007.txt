The Peoples Ownership
of Railroads

The people now own the railroads.

Every citizen has a voice in railroad regu-
lation whether he is a share or bond holder
or not. The

\ are owned by. over 30,000 share and bond
holders. Many of these are savings banks,
trust companies, estates, etc., with thousands
of other share holders in turn.

Hence railroad problems, involving state and
national regulation of rates; wages, finances,
operation, etc., are. the people’s problems.
It is the desire of the New York Central

Lines to cooperate closely with all the
public to solve these problems correctly:

FRUIT GROWERS’ CONVENTION.

At ‘the Provincial Fruit Growers’
convention just closed in Toronto,
some very interesting papers were
read, among them “What are the
causes of occasional light crops
tree fruits?’ In the opinion of W. T.
Macoun, Dominion Horticulturist, as
expressed at the convention, the chief
znuse 48 found in weather conditions.
The fruit buds from which this year's
apples will come were formod in June
or July of last year. Trees which were
efoliated last June or July, or other
wise weakened, cannot be expected to
sive a large crop next sutumn. Steady
cold weather during winter will not
likely couse damage to these buds,
but sudden and violent changes from
cold to mild weather may cause in-
'ury. If there Is wet and cold weath-
er at blooming time the get of fruit:
will be small, while warm sunny
weather pt blooming time will prove
favorable. Frost after the petals fall
2auses Jess injury than while bloom is
full, and much depends on how long
the cold dip at blooming period lasts.
It is important in planting to select a
slope, as there may be a difference of
9 to 10 degrees in temperature on high
ind low ground. Too heayy spraying
at blooming period may effect fertiliz-
ation; lack of moisture in the ground
it blooming time may do the same
ind weak fertilization will conduce to
a heavy June drop. In order to as-
sure a supply of moistufe ag the right
time orchards
early in spring As a further assur-
ance of annual crops, Mr. Macoun ad-
vised planting some of the hardiest
varieties, as these are less subject to
seasonal injury.

In dealing with the control of scab
on apples, Prof. Caesar said. the germ
of the scab cannot develop without
moisture. Infection occurs ten days
before scab appears, hence spraying
is preventive, not curative. The
greatest danger of infection is from
just before the bloom bursts until two
or-three weeks after petals fall. Fall
ure immediately before or immediately
after bloom means scabbed fruit in
alinost any season, and the damage is _
greatest of course in a season of much
moisture before and duriogy, the
