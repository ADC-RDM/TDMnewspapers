APPORTIONING THE COST
Certain Roads Likely to be Set Asfde

for Construction Work.

At a conference between the special
committees of the London council,
county council and board. of trade,
held one day last week, W. A. Mec-
Lean, Toronto, in charge of highway
matters, explained’ the system of
suburban roads at some length, No
action was taken pending the decision
of the Ontario Rallway and Municipal
Board, on the request of the county
council that a commission be appoint:
ed to take over the matter for Lon-
don and Middlesex county.

Mr. McLean expained that the mat-
ter of improving roads leading to
citles immediately adjacent to these
municipalities had resulted in a com-
mission of investigation. It was found
that the great traffic on the roads con-
verging into cities had resulted fin
heavy outlays for upkeep, and it was
thought advisable to consider ways
and means for building more perma-
nent ronds and apportioning the cost.
In other countries the cities bore the
greater portion of the load. For in-
stance, the cities in New York state
paid $5 per cent, of the total cost; in
Massachusetts, 82 per cent., and In
Michigan, 86 per cent. There was “a
different organization so far as muni
cipal government was concerned in
the States, but the principle of the
cities bearing the llon's share: of the

Suburban Roads.

After going Into the matter it was
| thought best to set aside certaln roads

construction and upkeep to be divided
among the Provincial Government, the
county and the city. The Government
would pay 40 per. cent. of the con-
struction: work, the city and county to
pay 30 per cent. each. The type of
construction called for thé expendi
ture of §10,000 a mile, as this gave the
most satisfactory results, The Gov-
ergment would pay 20 per cent. of the
upkeep, the balance to be divided
