can gather together, anll' therefore it
gtands to reason that women shouldn't
try to make these colors fashionable at
the present moment, There seems no
immediate prospect of their dolng so,
The smartest color today is brown in
every possible shade and tone.

BEAUTY HINTS.

How to Take Care of Your Complexion
After Motoring. ot

Either hot or rold water applied to
the complexion directly after a long
automobile ride may do harm to the
skin. And water need not be expected
to take out the grime that hours of
facing wind and dust have driven into
the pores. A vigorous scrubbing at the
Journey's end will only make the flesh
stif and shiny and leave a painfol
burning sensation for hours thereafter.

Defer the hot. water bath for an hour
and apply. when you come in from
your ride, some good cold. cream, plas-
tering it thickly over the face, around
the ears and on the neck. Then rub it
off with a soft cloth and powder lightly
with talcum. The cool, fresh feeling
will be very different from the stiff,
hot sensation following & soap and wa-

MAY HAVE FUEL DEPOT.

Ontario Rallway Board Approved By-
Law of Town of Forest.

The Ontario Railway Board made an
order last week approving of the by-
law of the town of Forest to establish
a fuel depot in that town.

Mr, Wallace, counsel for the town,
stated’ that there were only two men
thero who handled coal, and that
was only a part of their regular busi
ness, They could handle but a lHmit-
ed supply, and Forest, with a popula-
tion of 1,600, needed something like
16,000 to « 20,000 tons of coal a year.
The town does not intend to interfere
with the business of these two men
if they can supply all the coal needed.
but they, want to be prepared to, sup-
ply coal should these mén fall down.
The. coal will be sold on a cash basis,
and the by-law asked for the {ssue of
