“How 18 he?” she demanded. from

«Better; ho has a chanee,” answered
Latham. “This way for the cab,

Latham could nob tell on the fourney

Welr or not. She was 80 quiet and self
composed, 80 eminently mistress of
herself, that he felt an unworthy de-
sire to say something that would cut

Arab Dancing Girls.

An English traveler thus describes
the Arab dancing girla he eaw at A
air at Biskra, in the Sahara: “Here,
gurronnded by a rope, on raised deal
benches, sit the dancing girls. Beneath
them. is a. deal table” covered with
strange sweetments and sirups. Oppo-
site to them Is a bench, upon whida,
after a small payment, you may install
yourself and admire Zora, Fatima, Al-
chouch or Algia at your ease. They
are worth seeing in thelr gala attire.
Indeed, they look like a troupe of mag-
nificent, chattering macaws perch
{n the sum Some, the real Ouleds,
wear crowns of gold, surmounted by
tufts of tinted ostrich. feathers. Upon
their painted fingers. are heavy bare
baric rings. “Upon thelr arms are
massive gold and silver bracelets. Vells
of gold and silver tissue float around
them, half concealing their robes of
pink, yellow, magenta, scarlet and
bright green silk. One wears a broad
band of  dinmonds across her broad
forehead. Another bas pawed her enr
rings upon strips of velvet and is lit-
erally clud-in gold colns, which make
the eyes of the Arabs glitter greedily.
A third, th wonderful Gazela, can
gearcely move to the gweetment table
to drink a glass of sirup with an ebon
admirer, so loaded 18 sho with neck-
laces, amulets and ankle rings.”

‘including a New Remedy.

The bran of mash mixture i8 probs
ably used more than any othor meth-
od, It Is made by uping 60 pounds of
bran or dn inferior grade of flour to
one pound of Paris green. The mix.
ture is then moistened with 2 gallons
of water, and sweetened with one gal-
lon of molasses. It should then he
thoroughly mixed. After mixing well
the poison bait is ready for the cut-
worm. On one to’two days previous
to plenting a fleld of tobneco this
mixture should be sown broudcast Inte
in the afternoon or in the evening. It
1s very destructive to the cutworms
{if properly mixed, and is effective till
it becomes very dry or till a rain
comes. ‘

Another method consists In dipping
green bits of clover, cabbage, or any
green tender stuff In a golution made
by using one pound of Paris green to
50 gallons of water, and scattering the
green material thus treated ot inter-
vals of 4 few feet late in the evening.
This method involves too much labor
to be used on a large scale, but it is
very effective,

During the past season a mixture
of arsenate of lead, in the paste form,
fn the, proportion of 1 pound of the
paste to 7 gallons of water was used
to control the cutworms. The plants
were pulled from the bed at trans-
planting time, dipped roots and all in.
to the solution, and thon set in the
fleld, When they dried off a good
white coating covered the plant. The
growth of the plant was good, and no
damege was done to the iolinge with
this strength solution. The arsenate
of lead adliered to the let and stem
of the young plant well, not being
easily washed off by rain.

This method gave excellent results
last year. Very. few plants that had
been treated were attacked by the
cutworma, but where no trectment
was given to the plants the cutworms
did o great deal of damage. The main
disadvantage of the method is that as
the plants are dipped the soll adher-
ing to their roots comes” off in the
solution and makes it very dirty: The
plants should also be set very soon
after dipping. ;

The difficulty of the sclution bécom- [|

ing so dirty. as to meke it unfit for
use can be largely overcome by mak-
ing a kind of cotton cloth basket or
putting cotton on the inside of an or-
dinary basket and dipping basket ond
all into the solution. Very littlertime
would then re required for dipping
the plants.

Ancther way, of applying the solu-
tion tould be to epray {t onto the
plants with a knapsack sprayer Just
after they are set, A large quantity
of solution would be required because
it would be necessary to apply it
heavy enough to cduse some of the
liquid. to rum down the stem of the
plant, lenving it white on drying.

This method has been tried for only
one year, butithe results, seem to jus-
tify its being given on trial by anyone
who hns had tobacco attacked by
cutworms or fears an rttaclk this
spring. The cost should be compar-
atively small for dippi:g enough plants
for several acres.
