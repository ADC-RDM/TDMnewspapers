AND LAYMEN'S CON-
FERENCE.

\

The Pastors’ and Laymen's Confer-
ence of the Western Baptist~Assocla-
tion was held jn the Essex Baptist
church on Wednesday, November,
a8th. With just a few exceptions all
the churches in Essex and Kent coun-
ties were represented. © “Intenslye
Cultivation of Qur Church Life” was
the theme of the day. The Rev. D. D.
Burtch, of Palmyra, presided. In the
morning session the Rev, W. C. Pearce
of Presden led un discussion on “In-
tefisive Cultivation of the - Sunday
School.” Mr. Laramie, of Colchester,
opened the afternooh, session. Rov.
W. D. Magee, of ‘Essex, in dealing
with the ‘Intensive Cultivation of the
Evening Session” deplored the lack of
thrill that was once characteristic of

ithe evening service, and pointed out

the ‘deep responsibility imposed and
opportunity afforded by such a ser-
vice, as no other lends itself so rend-
ily to evangélistic effort. In the even-
ing service there Is tho lure of possi-
bility, as in farming, and to cultivate
intensively, Is to gather every possi
bility that lends itself to farming.

Rev. W. A..Ashmore, of Windsor,
gave o very original address on “In-
tonsive Cultivation of the Rural
Church.” How to get the largest aum-
ber of people within _ sound of the
preacher's voice, anl how to reach
those who mever go Into a church
building, were among the problams he
hondled. One of the Dest means of
Intensive Cultivation sald the speaker
Is the systematic community survey
in which he would enlist the services
of the chdrch members. Some church
members would. scom to think of a
one man ministry, yét they created it
by Inck of co-operation.
