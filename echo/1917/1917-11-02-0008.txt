Ottawa, October 26th.—An order-in-
Council has been passed by the Do:
minlon Government authorizing regu-
lations. Issued by the Fuel Controller
for Canada respecting ‘the ‘4impor-
tations and sale of coal, which went
into effect on the 1st day of Novem
ber..

Provision Is made for the lirensing
of all Importers and dealers fa coal
now doing business in Canada, and
that may hereafter desire to do so.
Application must be made to the Fuel
Controller before the 21st of Novem-
ber, by registered letter, for a dealer's
or importer's permit. Heavy penalties
are provided for doing business with.
out permit. Provision ls also made
for the cancellation of permits In
cases where any dealer has been foun :
gullty of giving short weights or
where any other sufficient cause ex-
ists. a

Under the regulation every mine
operator In Canada must forthwith
enter into an agreement with the Fuel
Controller fixing the maximum pri-
ces. per ton he may chage for the
output of his mine.

Maximum Profits Fixed.

The most farsreaching provisions of
the new regulations are those deal-
Ing with packers’ commissions and
profits. Brokers gre allowed a max-
imum of 30 cents per ton for their
services. Wholesalers, a maximum of
35 cents per ton; and retail dealers a

Sum not exceeding 50 cents per ton.
These maximum profits are allowed
over an? above isonsble overhead
and handling charges, and and ef-
fectually do away with profiteering In
coal.

The regulations also set forth the
methad to. be adopted by wholesale
and retall dealers conl to arrive
and the cost prices thereof. Every
two weeks an average will be struck
by such dealers of the cost of all coal
an hand; which will be the governing
price for the ensuing period of two
weoks.

Three Tons fer customers.

Stringent regulations are made [n
regard to the hoarding of coal. It {s
ordered that between the months of
April'and September, inclusive in each
yepr, ng consumer shall obtatin any
quantity\of coal in excess of the_es-
timated supply for two months with
a maximums, allowance of three tons,

Provision 18 also made whereby
dealers may procure a formal state.
ment from their customers tothe ef-
fect that they are not ovaer-supplied ac-
cording to the resolution

May Requisition Supplies.

The most: drastic part of the regu.
lations. Is perhaps that dealing with
cases of emergency when the Fuel
Controller -. will "Have power to re-
quisition any quantity. of coal in the
possession of any customer in excess
of the legal supply pérmitted’ under
the regulations, It is not the inten:
tion of the Fuel Controller to disturb
those who have their winter supply
of fuel lald in except in case of emer-
gency when the public interest may
demand that they; shall share the ex:
cess supply with their neighbors. In
working out this pant of the regula
tions the Mayor, Reeve, Warden* or
overseer of any municipality, may be
made the agent of the Fuel Con-
troller. y
No Frivolous Complaints.

A provision of the regulations fs
no charge ghall “be laid against any,
coal dealer or hroker without’ first
submitting the fact td the Fuel Con-
troller and obtaining his consent Jn
writing.

This" is to, avold frivolous com-
plaints and to epable the Fuel Con-
troller to consider complaints In the
lightoof information as to costs, ete.
In his possession or to enable him*to
get further ‘evidence "so as to ensure
that no, prosccution fs made without
there being reasonable grounds for
such action.
