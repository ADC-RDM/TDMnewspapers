BUTTER AND EGGS }

acting commissioner on the cost of
Hving, in his monthly report on food
commodities, covering the amount of
food held in cold storage on November

October figures as to butter in
storage / showed a twonty-four- per
cent. increase, and November “figures
showed n thirty-four per cent. increase
as compared with a year BgO. The
commissioner finds “It difficult to ap-
preciate oither.thd reason or, necessity
for this” He points out that butter
{8 not a scasonable commodity, and the
cnlizable oxport demand is" not ab
normal. In hi& opinion the » ruling
price of butter is unnaturally high, and
i8 held up, to some oxtent, at least,
by means of unjustifiable accumula-
tion. A

commissioner,” should decline.

UNDERDRAINAGE AT _
THE EXPERIMENTAL
FARM, OTTAWA

White the Central Experimental
Farm was yet in {ts infancy the ‘ne-
cessity for installing a system of un-
derdrainage was realized. From year
to year the system Has been Improved
and extended until at the present time
a very complete drainage scheme is
in operation. Soil conditions vary
greatly. The surface sofl ranged from
sand to clay with all intervening
types. Besldes there nre considerable
lareas of muck. The subsoil is of the
same variable character and in many
places the problem of combatting quick
or running sand is encountered. The
contour of the land may be termed
gently to abruptly roling,, Inclined to
form pockets or basins, and pn the,

| whole having little natural outlet. Un-

der these conditions, the problem of
drainage was rather a difficult one en-
tajling considerable thought and ac-
curate “work, Three main outlets
are used, two located at the western
and one at the eastern boundary. In
explanation of the system it may be
confined to a combination or modifi-
cation of the herring-bone, gridiron
and across-the-slope systems of drain-
age. The first rescribed system is well
sited to drain ponds or basins; the
second or gridiron sytem ob adapted
to level land Where the dralnnge re-
quired is fairly uniform; tho across-
the-slope system is usedgon side hills
and slopes.

Clay tile were

used throughout,

| varying In sizexfrom 3 to-10 inches.

THe smaller than threednch were
considered too small in this Instance
and. are not recommendéd for ordin-
ary, conditions.

Sand traps or slit basins are indig:
pensible, furnishing clearanceé for the
fine sand that enters the tile and
which, if not provided for, would lodge
fn and clog euch tile as are Iald on
somewhat less than a two-inch grade.
These sand traps are of different
aizes according to requirements, Somo
are six feet square while the major-
ity are approximately four feet square,
extending into the ground’ about two
feot below the outlet tile, thus pro-
viding smple space for considerable
deposits of sand and silt. The traps
are enclosed by concrete walls, six
inches thick. flush with ‘the surface
of the ground and covered by con-
crete tops provided with manholes

protected by gratings. They are lo-| |

cated, as far as practicable, odjacent
to roadways, fences or other suitable
places
obstruction In cultivated fields.

The depth and’ distance apart of the

drain vary withssoll conditions.” In

Clay subsoil, the Iatorals are as close ||

ss forty feet at a depth of approx!
mately three feet. In lighter solls the
jaterals are farther apart and often

.| deeper in the ground, especially to-}

wards the outlats. 5

‘With regard to the maintenance of a
drainage -system the most” important
factor to observe is to practice sye-|
tematic inspection of the whole and
prompt repair of part or parti. that
require attention. This 1» essential
for. n low cost of maintenance and for
an officlent system. 5
