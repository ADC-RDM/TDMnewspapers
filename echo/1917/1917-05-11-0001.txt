SATISFACTION

Wherever you find Ford cars and Ford seryice, you find
SATISFIED FORD OWNERS—men who appreciate the car
for its quick starting, its easy control, its simplicity and
its extraordinary capacity for hard work.

The phenomenally large sale of Ford cars is the direct
result of Ford SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION.

Ford satisfaction is as universal as the Ford car itself.
Doctors, lawyers, salesmen, bakers, grocers and farmers
all praise the Ford—all arésatisficd. »
