INTERPRET MEANING
OF DWELLING.

 

Buildings at the rear of one's home
are not a part of the dwelling place,
under the-meaning of the Ontario Tem-
perance Act, {t- was decided in the
York County Court last week when
an appeal from the Police Magistrate's
decision dismissing a charge against
H..J. Brett, Toronto, of violating the
Temperance Act, was sustained by the
County Judge. Brett was condemned
to pay a fine of $200 and costs. In
January Iast in a building at the rear of
Brett's home the police found a guan-
tity of liquor. When Brett appeared
before the Police Magistrate he plead-
ed that the building at the rear was
part of his dwellng place and that he
dd not violate the law by having the
liquor there. Magistrate Denison uj.
held this contention and dtvmissed tia
charge. Crown Prosecutor Corlg
was dissatisfied with this vevdigt. ahd

was here on his way to his western

“down enst”; or he wns en route from
Ontario or Quebec to try his fortunes
{n the Pralrie Provinces; or he came
to make his home under the Stars and
Stripes and be-a citizen of - the
public. We have given the glad hand
to hundreds of these muscular, rosy-
checked, optimistic-eyed, alert-minded
fellows, and In numerous cases have
introduced them to their first job this
side of the border.

To-day we see very few of them,
and, to be frank, we don't want to
spe any at all. The other day a well
got up “Canuck of 28 or 30 made his
appearance and after remarks on. the
state of the weather in Montreal and
Chicago, inquired about chances of
employment in the Windy City. We
felt like saying something brutally
frank, but checked the impule,
thinking ‘perhaps he had a ‘valid* ex-
cuse for being away from his native
land In its time of great peril.

“The recruiting folks didn't want
vou?" we queried. “I didn't ask
them,” the young patriot sald, knock-
ing the ashes out of his pipe. “You
see, I don't beleive in Canadians mix-
ing In this row across the water. Let
Britain fight her own battles—that's
my sentiment.”

He went on to insinuate that there
were many with similar {deas In the
nine provinces, but we cut him short
by a reference to the recruiting fig
ures which, in the matter of voluntary
enlistment place Canada at the head
of every nation on earth, Canada's out-
pouring of service and sacrifice—blood
and treasure—seemingly had made 1jt-
tle impression on this spiritually de-
cadent, kinsman. “There gre: excep-
tions to every rule,” we told’ him, giv-
fng him to understand that le was
one of the sort we had very little use
for, and he went out to seek local aid
and influgnce elsewhere, We hope he
found neither; that he was forced to
snenk back whence he came; and that
he will somehow be shamed into do-
ing his duty.

We hear of dozens of “slackers,”
Ilkke this one, reaching Detroit and
other boundary centres from the Do-
minion. Every land Is humilinted by
such ungrateful sons in {ts times of
. The coward and deserter and
r arg not confined to any flag
or nation. If the United States goes
to war next week, Uncle Sam will be
left In the lurch by thousands who
have already signified their Intention
to let the Hun do his worst with Old
Glory.

But among the baser of the. humun
breed, let us remember, is the man
who does not believe tn defending his
country’s lonor. He Is very close to
the infamous wretch who could see
his wife or mother insulted without
being stirred to prompt vengeance.—

HIGH PRICES FOR SHORTHORNS.

   
 

  

  

       
   
 

 
   

  

 

 

Higher prices were paid last week
for pure-bred Shorthorns at the West-
ern Ontario sale in London, than have
been offered at any previous sale un-
der the same auspices. The highest
priced bull was Original, sired by Best
Boy, sold by Grand.H. WW. Nicholson

| to A. E. Stevenson, of Port Huron, for

$500. A number of females sold for
more than $500, one bringing the re-
cord price of $1,160. This was ‘Athel-
i'stgne Roséwood 7th, three years old,
Ibred by Willlam Waldle, Stratford. F.

chaser. The next highest bld.was $700

SHORT SYRUP SEASON. °
Contrary to expectations up to af
few days ago, Its now belleved that |
the period of maple sugar-making will
be Vvepy short. Farmers state that
there Is very little frost in the ground,
due to the mild weather of the past
few days and the depth of the snow
throughout the winter. The [deal
syrup-making weather consists of
bright sunshine and warm winds Sur !

he
advent of the present mild spell has
upset calculations entirely, and the
general bellef {s that the supply of)
syrup Will likely be below the aver-
age. . . 2

On almost every side there is evi
dence of active preparations on the
part of citizens to takegup gardening |
at the earliest opportunity. . Back-|
yards are now being cleaned up and

USE CEMENT TILE |

The efficiency of tile drainage depends upon the nature of the tile
used. Practical tests*have proven Cement Tile is br far the most
efficient and economical. :

For one thing, Cement Tile 1s frost and weatherproof. Another
point {3 the Cement Tile will actually get better with age. A third
reason is that Cement Tile {s always uniform in shape and thick-

Doss of walls, Yet—Cement Tile is 48 cheap, or cheaper, than clay, -

and increased value to the land." Drained land can be worked earlier
and easier, and produces more. .Drainage is the best investment
you can make. _ § :
