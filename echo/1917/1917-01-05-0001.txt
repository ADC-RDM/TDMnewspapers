A Story of Japan §

By CLARISSA MACKIE :
ARR RAGA AAT ROG RAERI

Wendell bad been In Japan a week

[ when he decided to lenve Nagasaki and

| make his headquarters in a tiny fish-

i ing village.

{ The motive came upon Ray Wendell
the very day he decided to leave Nagn-
suki. 4

It came In the shape of a typhoon.
Toward noon there was a cloud before
the sun. t

Everything portable was fastened as
tightly as possible, and then all one
could do was to pray for dellverance
from the whirlwind.

Even the foreign population living in
the substantially bullt hotels and Inrge
private residences recognized the signs
of approaching storm.

A yellow light seemed to brood over
the city. Birds flew restlessly among
the trees and shrubs In the gardens,
and mothers gathered their little ones
into the house,

In the bazaars the boxlike counters
were quickly telescoped, the stock in
trade vanished ns magically and only
the swaying signboards and paper lan-
terns were left to rustle warning,

Wendell, walking toward the ticket
office to see about reservations for his

where the busy thoroughfare became a

sea, not a sail in sight and the shipping
in the harbor rocking uneasily.

All at once the typhoon came scream.

ries let loose.

Frail roofs were Ilfted like paper and
salled through the alr like huge kites.

Wendell gasped for bréath and clung

niture, clothing, uprooted trees, sign.

There were shrill screams as women
fled toward their frail homes. Clogs
clattered on the pavements and there
were tinkling crashes of porcelnin-as

|. Amid the e¢rie ringing of temple
bella sounded the hoard, nes of
warning whistles in the harbor. The
cries of fying jinrikisba runners were
lost in the pandemonium of sound.

Wendell wondered what he should
do. He could not find his way. back to

He lost all’ sense of loca-

the hotel, yet he must find some place *

of refuge and find it very soon.

When the blighting wind had passed
over the city there might follow its
aftermath—the tidal wave. Very like-
ly the shops in the harbor were pre-
paring to meet the shoreward thrust
of the mighty waters.

Wendell tried to hail a rikisha man.
He might get back to the hotel. But
every vehicle was filled and his call
was unnoticed. He addressed” one or
two fleeing passersby, He offered
money to be guidéd to the hotel. But
his offers were ignored. The wind

tore the words from his lips, and no °

matter which way he turned he met
absorbed, fear set faces or fleeing blue
"cotton backs. |

“I will go with the wind,” he mut-
tered savagely, and with this resolve
in mind he swung around the next cor-
ner and with the wind at his back felt
himself tmpelled with great velocify.

The street he was now on was fre
from shops and he. could see glimpses
of red tled roofssamong the crypto-
marias in the gardens. Here the wind
was tearing tile from the roofs and
lashing the trees to destruction.

Wendell saw a group of Japanese
scudding down the street 10 some safe-
ty they had in mind. The street
sloped gharply downward. Suddenly
something finshed . past the * young
American and be heard a girl's fright-
ened cry.

Strange things few past him—lighter

safety. i

It was growing darker now, and there
was an ominous hush.

Ho did not catch ler roply. Some
wordg left ber lips, ut were lost in
the sudden screnm of the storm. The
whole’ world snddenly became an up-
roar of wind and thr lash of waves
from the sen. Amid fiat cataclysm of
sound the man and the girl and the
Jinrikisha tore down the hill. Wendell,
between the poles if the light vehicle,
wondered where the Insane journey
would end.

His question was quickly answered.

Without warnng they crushed into a
hedge of some sweet smelling shrub.
Wendell received the full force of the
blow as he was propelled through the
shrubbery on to what wns apparently
the lawn of a gentleman's place.

The jinrikista stuck in the hedge.

“I am al! right,” quavered the girl's
volce out of another momentary cessa-
tion of sound.

“Good!” muttered Wendell, reaching
over and I\fting her from the vehicle
“Perhaps we can find shelter in the
house.”

They stumbled down a path and into
a portico, where they paused to take
breath. Wendell finshed a tiny electric
light and disclosed the doorway to a
temple. The large cedar doors were
closed, but a smaller door further
along the portico admitted them to the
hnsh of a small temple.

Incense was drifting lazily from
bronze koro on the votive tables. A
large statue of Buddha loomed in the
background. There was the sickly
scent of dying blossoms. Somewhere
up in the roof a deep throated bronze
bell boomed solemnly as the wind
swayed It to and fro.

“Are we safe here?’ asked the girl,
clinging tightly to Wendell's arm.

“As sife as anywhere in Nagasaki
just now,” he replied. “Sit down -here
and {f you do not like to look at the
image taco the doorway.”

He drew a number of clean white
mats from the floor and piled them be-
side one of the pillars of the temple.

“Oh, I like the face of the Buddha,”
she hastened to say. “It is so calm
and peaceful—after the storm!” She
broke down and began to sob softly.

Wendell turned and went softly away.
Left to herself, he argued, she would
quickly recover her poise.

Within the thick walled temple one
heard vague rumblings of the storm.
Wendell moved slowly among the vari-
ous smaller shrines and marveled at
the singular absence of the priests. He
decided that they had sought refuge in
some safer place, perhaps some larger
temple near by.

The votive table was laden with of-
ferings of flowers, rice and wine. On
the steps of the shrine was a small
black lacquered box. Wendell picked
it up and found it to be ome of those
tiny portable stoves which the Japa-
nese are fond of using. Inside was a
small brazier of glowing charcoal, and
in one of the drawers were teacups and
tea, and in the other compartment
were tiny rice cakes. Some priest had
dropped his tea equipage in his hurried

Wendell blew the coals into flame,
put on a tiny copper water kettle and
presently made tea in the Japanese
fashion in the small porcelain bowls.
These he carried to the girl 1

She wns sitting up now, and he
could see her face quite clearly. She
was very lovely with wide gray eyes
and sweet mouth,

“Tea?" she aSked incredulously.

He nodded. “And rice cakes, too, if
you want them,” he said. “You will
feel better afterward.”

They sat together on the mats and
drank the tea and ate the priest's rice
cakes. When they had finished"'Wen-
dell dropped a handful of coins in the
box and returned it to the place where
he had found it.

Listening, he decided that the storm
had abated in a mensure and, going to
to the door, thrust his head out into
the portico. The world was bathed in
a glory of golden sunshine,

“Come,” he called to his companion.
“I think we may go now.” .

She joined him and cried aloud at
the transformation. The temple garden
was in ruins, Along the roadside peo-
ple were hastening to their deserted
homes. The roid was muddy.

As Wendell belped Alice Lovell up
the hill toward the storm beaten city,
he felt that something new had come
into his life with the typhoon. Love
had: come riding on the crest of the
storm. It bad passed him for an in-
stant, but he had ‘caught it. He

He went with her to the hotel, where
her friends were frantically searching
for her, His meeting them and listen:

cue was like a drehm. The only real
thing was the girl and himself.

As he paid goodby in the hotel gar-

he asked.

“A month,” she answered.
