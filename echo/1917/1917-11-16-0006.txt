ter of Labor in the. Laurier Govern-
ment, was unanimously nominated as
o straight Laurier ,candidate for the
House of Commons at a largely attend-
ed meeting of the North York Reform
Association held at Newmarket Sat-

Depressing statistics about the Jloss-
es in war come not so frequently from
soldiers themselves but mainly from
civilians who have never, as the old-
fashioned feller used to say, even shot
off an ash barrel. Harold R. Peat,
who recently sorved two years with
the Airst Canadian contingent, and
whose Hook, “Private Peat,” is now
available, says: “The worst part of
the ‘war fs over, whether it lasts six
months or.six years longer, because
you fellows (the Americans) will go
over there knowing-tfiat the Germans
are licked. Only one man in 25 gets
killed, and that's pretty cheap to get
to seesthe biggest <ircus in the world.”

$5,500,000 IN BONDS.

ready subscribed to Canadian war
