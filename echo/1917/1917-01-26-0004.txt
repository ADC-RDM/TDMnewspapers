We have no carpets so cheap as these—cheap yet
good. They have lots of wear in them and are very fine
in appearance—not quite so sleek as a Wilton and per-
haps not so easily kept clean, but for: wear they can't be

excelled.

and have not advanced them in price—although similar

goods would cost double. Almost any color can be had

Any one requiring a bedroom or dining room carpet,

price is any object—ifor these heawy Scotch Wool Rugs

at these prices assuredly are.
