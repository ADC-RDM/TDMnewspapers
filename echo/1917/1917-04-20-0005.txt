OF WHITE BURLEY TO
© BE GROWN IN ONTARIO

 

There are two distinct types of
White Burle/ mow being grown in
the Burley sotion, namely: the orig-
inal Broadleaf und the Improved
Standard Builey.

The Broadles, as the name indl-
cates, J8 a large type with broad,
drooping leaves, Inrge veins, n heavy
vialder, and on account of the large
sap content of the leaves, It 18 in
clined to cure up a jittle dark.

The Improved Standard is a some-
what smaller type than the Broadleaf
Burley, with narrow, erect leaves,
smaller veins, of a little finer texture
than the Broad lect, and, on accotnt of
a smaller sap content in the leaves, it
Is: Inclined to cure a little byighter
colour, The narrow leaves also tend
to decrease the percentage of Wrap-
pers In the Standup Burley.

Since the popularity of, and the re-
turns realized from, any type of 1P-
bicco, depend largely on the quality
of toc cured produce and the yield per
acre, experiments were conducted #t
the Hurroyr Tobacco Stytion during thé
past season to determine the merits
of the two types. Four plois of
ground with as nearly the same tex-
ture, character and fertility ss possible
were selected. Two of these plots
were planted to Broadleaf Burley, and
two to the Improved Standup Burley,
respectively. All four plots were
planted at the same time, with plants
as nearly uniform in size and vigor as
possible; fertilized alike; culticated
allke; and harvested and cured under
the same conditions,

The following table glves the results
obtained: —

Since the above table gives the

sults of only one year's experiments,
and- the past growing season. was a
very poor one, these results cannot be
taken too conclusively, However, they
are-a’ fair indication that the yleld
obtained. with the Broadleaf type I4
appreciably greater than the yield ob-
tained with the Standup type, and also
that the increased percentage of bright

ly large enough to offset the increased

and Warne and Hickory Prior, which
