.—The Horticultural Sociaty has

completed the first inspection and
judging of the more than eighty gar-
dens entered by Amherstburg school
children {in the Back Yard Vegetable
Garden Contest. In the class of gar-
dens of 150 square feet are 46 com-
petitors from among the younger chil-
dren; 25 competitors in the 260 square
feet gardens, and about the same num-
ber in the 400" square feet class. The
judges report that generally the gar.
dens are above the usual order of
merit. A fine variety of vegetables
hos been raised, which are well lonk-
ed after, kept clean and “nicely ar-
rangéd. Old gardeners will have to
hustle to beat the gardens of the
school amateurs.

—Women teachers employed by
Windsor school board must make up
thelr minds to become *“6ld maids,”
The border city’s school trustees have
decided against re-engaging teachers
who contemplate marriage; This de.
clglon was made Tuesday night, when
Mrs. Harry Harris (nea Maisie -Mc-
Kim) and Miss Irvine applied for po-
sitions on the teaching staff. Mrs.
Harris is the bride of a Kingsville
soldier, S&while Miss Irvine, one of the
most successful teachers at Assump:
tion street sohool, is engaged to be
married. Trustee Fred. Allworth, the
only bachelor on the board, supported
the cause of the married ladies but
was “trun down,” The members of
Windsor school board act more like a
bunch of “old women™ than like any-
thing else -having human shape. Jub!
why war brides should be penalized
is mighty ‘hard to understand. -

—*“George Connors, of Parkhill, Do-
minion fruit” inspector, was a visitor
in London Monday on his way to
Leamington. ‘The strawberry grow-
ers are not filling their boxes the way
they. ‘should,’ sald Mr. Connors. I
find that practically oll the berry box-
es that 1 have examined through the,
district have been but two-thirds full.
I have warned a number of men same.
on your own market, and they have
got to live up to the law. When the
public are paying for a full box, they
ahould get a box with the berries even
with the top. There were few baorries
in the stores to:day, but I could mot
find a crate that had covery Dox: filled
properly, However, as 1 said before,
the growers have recelved their warn-
ing, and it is up to them from now
on. I will be back later in the week
to look over the market again. !"'—8t.

SATISFACTION

Wherever you find Ford cars and Ford service, you find
SATISFIED FORD OWNERS—men who eppreciate the car
for its quick starting, its easy control, its simplicity and
its extraordinary capacity for hard work,

The phenomenally large sale of Ford cars {b the direct
result of Ford: SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION.

Fer satisfaction 18 as universal as the Ford car itself.
Doctors, lowyers, salesmen, bakers, grocers and farmers
all prajse the Ford—all are satisfied.

Its Jow..cost appeals to them. Its unusually low upkeep
cost pleases them, Its sturdy, sténdy, service-giving char
acter wins them and satfsfles them. Even the wealthy
prefer to drive Ford cars rather than bot] .r with the cost-
ly, cumbersome limousine and. chauffeur. It means econ-
omy,when “saving is a national duty.”

Ford satisfaction is just. bs valuable as upkolstery, or a
fancy finish, Ask any Ford owner about it.

If you intend to buy a Ford, place your order Sith the
nearest dealer.
