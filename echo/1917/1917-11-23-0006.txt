Dr. Danfel-Laferte, Detroit, from his
son, Capt. Alfred Laferte, who is serv-
ing In France with tho Harper hospital
unit. Capt. Laferte recejjtly received
a promotion from Mleutipant. The
letter was written in Pagjg on Novem-

The tour of the frojit ranks was
made in an ambulance cap, Capt. La-
ferte being accompanied phy a French

the Laferte family migrated 200 years

“We reached  Solssons, five miles

writes Capt. Laferte. “All of this trip
of course, was through the battle-
fields, miles of trenches and barbed-
wire entanglements. In the afternoon,
while buying gasoline, We saw an air-
plane battle.

“The battle contestants consisted
of two planes at the start, but very
soon many others joined until there
were nine of them. We could not tell
which was which, but the French fin-
ally drove the Germans back. Fin-
ally, the anto-aircraft guns opened up
and the sky was dotted with the black
puffs of breaking shrapnel, The Gers
mans had come over to attack the
French observation balloons, of which
we could count five from where we
stood.
