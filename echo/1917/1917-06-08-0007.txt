ANNUAL REPORT OF
EXPERIMENTAL FARMS

An interesting statemen: appears in,
the first volume of. tlie report of the
director of Government Experimental
Farms, whieh deals with the cost of
growing certein crops,’ as follows: —
Mangels, $1.66 a ton; ensilage corn,
$1.45 a ton; oats, 10.39 cents a bush-
el, and- hay, $6 a ton. The system of
farming represented in these expepf-
mentd is explained in the report. It
is also shown as a result of seven
yours’ experiments that in fertilizing
the soil a distinct advantage is shown
in the use of barnyard manure alofe,
over commercial fertilizer alone, The
experiments suggest the pogsibility
of combining the two profitably when
barnyard manure is. scarce or high-
priced. Referring to new strains of
grain being produced It is gtfited that
lrull-less and beardless barleys are re-
celving close attention with the
promise ,of some exceptional results.
Earlier’and more productive varieties
are being sought for, while, new
strains of oats, peits, beans, buckwheat
and flax are being tested. These are
but examples of the character of the
information contained In the 598
pages of this first volume that can be
received, ‘without cost, on application
to tlie Publicgtions Branch of the De-
partment of Agrieulture at Ottawa.

DUNAWAY ON
THE 4 AND B.

By JAMES EDMUND DINNING...

The G. P. A. put his head {nto the

general superintendent's doorway and
sald;

“Old Tympan's out there again, I
see, Palmer.”

“No use,” replied the general super-
intendent. “His name came in two
hours ago. I told him to report here
next time he got drunk. This finishes
him.”

Flve minutes Inter old Tympan, aft-
er forty years of service for tho A. and
B,, went tumbling down the stairs be
cause he was drunk at the Hancock
street switch the day the directors
went up the line. Palmer bad given
him a pass home, elghty miles up the
road, and then fired him with ten of
the words Palmer wasn't accustomed
to using on ordinary jobs.

Train No. 8 pulled in while Tympan
fumbled the pass on the platform, and
ho climbed in and found a double seat
In the smoker, “He knew only that he
was out of a job, with a full pint in
his coat and Palmer's transportation
to take him up home, where he could
camp down for the winter with the
boys. He bad threatened that many
times, They deserved it for letting
bim work for a living.

“Taking vacation, Tympan?’ asked
Hennessy of No. 8 when he came
through for tickets. Tympan admitted
he ‘was off for a bit of time up the
road.

“Guess you ain't coming back right
off,” taunted Hennepsy. “The return
check on your pass don't seem to be In
sight. Long lay off, ¢h, Tympan!”

Tympan sat up, pulling Ws hat over
his eyes.

“Dick Hennessy,” he sald, “you go
slow on yer kiddin’ 'r I'll roast you one
o' these days £'r bein’ so smart. They've
fired me, yoif ¢'n bet—yes, they have;
fired me good, but I'm next to Palmer
yet. An' I heard what Palmer told
the G. P. A. this mornin* about your
runnin’ over orders twice last week. I
know. somethin’, an’ don't you kid me
no more!”

Train No. 8's conductor ignored the
challenge, partly because he dared do
no more. He knew the whole operat-
ng department had been knocking ev-
erybody in sight because old Tympan,
invariably drunk and disorderly, held
hls job while better and younger and
sober men were overhauled In Palmer's
office for nothing more than leaving
stations half a minute ahead of or-
ders or falling to vise the annuil of
some of the spying directors who went
up and down. R. H. Palmer got a
master tongue lashing those days from
the rank and fille, and now that the
dismissal had really come Hennessy
wis no more skeptical than any of tho
others ¢oncerning the gengral superin-
tendent’'s honest intentfon of keeping
Tympan out of Bérvice.

Hennessy tried to conciliate Tympan
on his next trip through, but the old
man lay with his hat over his face,
steaming with rage, too angry even to
curse. No. 8 was mpking beautiful
work, and Hennessy felt better than
usual. He had eight cars with a big
loadsof women and kids and wanted to
be on time anyway because it was hie
Iny off that Saturday and there was an
all night game In the “club” at home,

At Inchburg Hennessy got his usual
orders, everything all straight, and left
on time. The rear brakeman found him
Just afterward And spid:

“Hear about the wild freight went
up ahead of us? She's a big one, and
it wouldn't surprise me If she got
stuck on the ong Misery and held us
at Lyshon.” }

Hennessy knew his man was right
Lyshon station 1s at the foot of a
thirteen mile grade known for good,
reasons as f‘the Long Misery.” If a
freight got hung there ahead of. No. 8,
it meant everything balled up, for the
A. and B. ip a single line, and the di-
rectors won't stand for. a. siding  be-
tween Lyshon and Oldtown, the sta-
tion at the crest of the Long Misery.

Before the mogil could gather herselr
to bock up and catch the breakaway
the fugitive secon was slowly moving
off, very slowly, down thesheéad end of
the Long Misers:

“Back up, Irph! Back up and catch
‘em!” gereeched Bitters. 4

“You enn't do It!" yelled a breathless
brakeman who fame up from the rear,
“because the geAr's Just completely out
o' the head o’ that section and there
wouldn’t be nothin’ to make a couplin®
to if you ecaVght ‘em, “Which It ain't
likely you'll dy anyway.”

Bitters was thinking of Hennessy
and No. 8. If NaS were on time, she
was just leaving Lyshon. Chances
were she was late. He knew Hennes
sy. It was for him to reach Oldtown
in time to stop Ne. 8 at Lyshon. Bit-
ters sickened at the thought of the.
Saturday night rush of women and
children which had given Hennessy's
train thd name of the “nursery ex-
press.”

They worked quickly then. In thirty,
secondg Bitters was in the cab, and his
Irish engineer was giving the mogul
steam enough and some to carry. Bit-
tern figured it was four miles to tho
gouly and the way they paced it off
made It Impossible for him to say he
was disappointed when he jumped off
at Oldtown.

“No. 8, hold her at .Lyshon. My
freight’s bu'sted, an’ thirty-three of
‘em aro’ on the grade, goin’ to beat
thunder!”

“No. 81” The dispatcher’s face was
ple crust. “She left Lyshon six min:
utes ago, late.” He went back to his
{nstrument and sent “Seventeen,” the
clear out signal, to warn the road
south of htm, but as he did #o he knew
that No, 8 was coming up Long Misery
ten minutes late, straight into the
teeth of the worst runaway the A. and
B. had known.

LJ LJ . LJ

Hennessy was fuming at Lyshon,
for he couldn't afford another second,
yet Oldtown had seen nothing of the
wild freight.

“Better walt for another report from
Oldtown,” said. the operator. But
Hennedsy was six minutes late then
and resolved to go on up the grade.
He signaled his engineer and jumped
on the rear. The brakeman was there
and grinned when the conductor cursed
his luck. 2

Hennessy, half way through the
door, wheeled. There, away back by
the station platform, only a fading bit
of dismal detail in the familiar view,
was old Tympan standing in the mid-
dle of the track and waving crossed
arms.

“Left and signaling us to come back
for him,” sald the rear brakeman.

Hennessy spoke eloquently, looking
at his watch. The time frightened
him. “Ill not go baék for him,” he
cried. “I can't be''—

There was that in the rear brake-
man's eyes which stopped Hennessy.
Suppose he should leave Tympan at
Lyshon over Sunday, with no. trains
either way, and suppose the old man's
pull with R. H. P. were still working,
and suppose the young husband of her
who was Nell Tympan, he who worked
in the G. P. A's office, should—

And there was old Tympan himself
standing in the middle of the track
and signaling, “Back up, back up,
back up.” Could he afford to Ignord
the old fellow? Though it hurt him to
do {t, he sald;

“No, L:belleve I'll go back for the
old guy, BUL"” :

The rear brakeman pulled the cord,
and Hennessy went In. to reckon just
how much over thirty minutes late,
he would be {nto Oldtown. .

There was no denying that old Tym-
pan was exceeding drunk. Hennessy
smothered his wrath with difficulty as
No. 8 backed into Lyshon, for. he
hadn't relished what he had heard go-
ing ‘through the day coaches. He leaned
out: toward the dirty figure reeling
across the platform and heard Tym-
pan’s idiotic laugh as he boasted of
baving called back the biggest train
on the road. “I jus’ went out there—
ri’ out there—and elgnnled, “Back up,’
and yer backed up, didn’ yer? I tell
yer, gents, there ain't er man o' the
ro'd darst ter dis-disobey my orders.”

There was a scramble on the plat-
form behind them, and.the dispatéher
came shrieking like a plow train at a
blind crossing,

“Back up, Hennessyy for all you're

. ° .

worth!” he shouted. “Runaway freight

_ Hennessy took the platform at Ly- |'—thirty something cars off the wild

shon before No. 8'8 brakes held her and
sought the dispatcher in the dingy sta-
tion. *

“Wild freight?’ echoed the telegra-
pher. “Yes)went up an hour ago. Big
train? Yes, big train, but she's got a
good rall, and T don't belleve she'll
shold you a minute.”

Hennessy went out and looked in the ©
book by the station. door. He found
where the wild freight had reported
and saw: with satisfaction that she was
in charge of Bitters, ono of the ring
and sure to do his best to get that

train coming dpwn the grade—be here
in less than a minute. Oldtown wired.
Oh, Hennessy, look up the line!”

It was a cloud of sand and dust at
the first curve in the Long Misery,
three miles away. wy

Hennessy’s knees wavered. The dis-

patcher struck” him with his fist be-

tween the shoulders, crying: “Quick,
man! Ron her back into the siding and
let the freight go by.”

to complain that they were horribly
