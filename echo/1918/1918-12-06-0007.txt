“May I see that paper, please$”
~“Certainly.” Then. Miss Borden
busied herself some minutes in the
reading of the article In question. She
started to read it again. At a endden
exclamation from her Robert looked
at her Inquiringly. >

“Where did you say you. used to
live?” .

“Morton, Ky.” f

“But, look, this notice reads. ‘Miss
Ruth Hampton of Berkeley, Cal.’ so it
can't be your Ruth!”

Robert snatched the paper eagerly
from her and for a long time studied
the cut. “No,” he said at length,
“there can't possibly be -two Ruth
Hamptons who look sufficiently alike
to be sisters.

“There has beén time enough for
themito have traveled clear around the
world, for all my koewledge of Ruth
and her mother; so withent a doubt.
the simple truth is that they have gone
to California to live,”

He sat a while In troubled silence,
and at last tried to fix his attention on
some briefs. It was uscless. His mind
wandered continually; and he asked
himself over and over “Why do I care,
why do I cafe?” There could be but
one answer! :

Before returning he visited a Western
Union office and sent '& telegram to
the postmaster of Morton. Of course
the message was an inquiry regarding
Ruth. But lis conclusions of the morn-
ing were confirmed by the answering
wire, sent dollect : “Ruth Hampton and
mother left Morton last; October.

now April! After some time @pent In

aboiit Ruth; but “the world is full of
a jiumber of things"—and wise men
keép busy. Robert was wise, hence

thing. When Ruth and her mother en-
tered to greet him they found him
seated stiffly, with a dingy, edge-worn
newspaper across his knees, Thelr
greetings were cordial, but Peters’ em-
barrassment Increased ; his tongue was
about as active as the Limbs of an
athlete who has been bed-ridden for
some weeks. Mrs. Hampton, being of
the same cloth as all tactful mothers,
presently withdrew.

“Bob,” Ruth demanded, “what on
earth 1s that newspaper that you have
been clutching so madly?’ He handed
it to her silently, the cut and article
folded on top.

She glanced It hurriedly through and
returned it. If Bob had looked he

“A broken engagement?’ she sup-
plied. “No. Never been engaged in

any more, The Ruth of Berkeley is

brother's daughter. You see, that ac-
counts for our extraordinary likeness

LAKE HAS APPROPRIATE NAME:

Body of Water In Eastern Turkestan
Resembles a Pendulumiin Its
Regular Swing. 4
Lake Lop-nor, the, wandering lake of
the desert of, Tayln-makan, In eastern
Turkestan, 18 the termination of the
River Tarkin. Like n pendulum, the
lnke has swung from the south to the
north of the desert, and back again,
since the memory of man. The wan-

Fderings of the Inke are a tradition

handed down from Yather to son for
centuries. The natives of the Inke
dhore have always followed the wa-
ters. 4 y
At present Lop-nor Is in the south-
ern part of the desert; a shallow
reedy body of water hardly deperving
the name of lake. Murky and unplens-
ant, it furnishes a livelihood to the in-
habitants of Its banks, the majority of
whom are fishermen.” In their frail
shallow bonts they cut through the
reeds,” fishing and' hunting for water
fowl along thé banks. In some places
the reeds are, too thick to admit the
passage of the boat ; in such cases,
howeyer, it Is possible to walk over
the water on rafts of dried and rotting
stems: The chlef native dellcacy is
the eggr of the reed:birds. °

“Lake Lop-nor is one of the hottest
plices on the map In the summer and
the coldest In the winter. During the
winter months the lake is entirely fro-
zen over, the temperature diving to 20
degrees below zero. In the summer
the combinatidn~of a temperature of
108 degrees and the innumerable files
nnd mosquitoes which swarm on the
bnnks moke Lop-nor anything but a
summer resort.

The explanation of the lake's wan-
derings lles In the fact that Tarin car-
ries every year quantities of glit to the
lake bed, which slowly rises. In time,
na hundred years or so, the river must
seck a new outlet, and the, pendulum
swings to the north or south of the
desertyas the cnse may be.

LOCATION MADE LAST

SUMMER BY MR. COSTE
New Well Will Be Connected at Once

With Main Line and
Others Drilled.

 

 

 

 

A brand new natural gas fleld, as-
suring a further supply of natural gas
for that district, has been dfscovered
about 30 miles enst of the city of
Lethbridge, through the painstaking
search of President Eugene Coste, of
the Canadian Western’ Natural Gnas,
Light, Heat and Power Company.

To Mr. Coste belongs the personal
honor of locating the field, and select-
ing the point for the first well, which
was brought in on November 7th last,
with an initial production of 4,000,000
cubic feet in 24 hours. Mr. Coste lo-
cated this field last summer, and drill-
ing on the well was commenced in
July.

To Cut in On Main Line.

The exact depth at which the gas
was struck has not been divulged, but
Manager Pearson, of the company,
stated that the new wall would be cut
in at once on the main line running
from the Bow Island field, and supply-
ing Lethbridge, Calgary and other
cities along the line,

While the new well {8 now producing
4,000,000 cublc feet dailythere will
not be this much added to the. pres-
ent gas supply, somply, for the reason
thal tlie pigssure in the main line 1s
such, at presentithat only about 1.
000,000 cublc feet of the 4,000,000
available from the ncw. well will enter
the line. The {mportance of the new
well as a reserve, of course, goes with-
out saying. «

Entirely New Field.

The greatest importance of the new
strike, however, fs the discovery of an
entirely new gas field, separate and
apart from the Bow Island field. So
important Is the find regarded by the

company that: plans “are being made |

for a big program of development in
the new fleld, and four or five more
wells will be sunk next surumér.

T@®e exact location of the new well

LLOYD GEORGE'S GREAT SPEECH

 

David Lloyd George, the British
Prime Minister, In a gpeech on Friday
snid the victory of tlle Entente Allies
has been due to the ceaseless valor
of their men nnd that it would be a
lesson to anybody who, in the future,
thought that they, as the Prussian
wir lords hoped, “could overlook this
little island in their reckoning.”

“We are now approaching the Pence
Conference,” the Premter continued.
“The price of victory is not vengeance

| no retribution. It {8 prevention. First
qf. all, what about those people wham:
we have received without question Tor
years to our shores; “10 = Whom we
gave equal rights with our own sons
and daughters. and who abused that
hospitality to betray the lind; to plot
against security, to spy upon it and to
gain such information as enabled the
Prussian war lords to inflict not pun-
Ishment but damgge and injury upon
the land that had received them as
guests? Never again!?

Mr. Lloyd George sald the interests
of security and fair play deminded'
that It should be made perfectly clear
that the people who acted in this way
merited punishment for the damage
they had inflicted.

Must Pay to the Limit.

The second question was the ques.
tian of indemnities, the Premier add
ed. In every conrt of justice through-
out the world the party which lost has
had to bear the cost of tho litigation.
‘When Germany defeated France she
established this principle, and there
was no doubt that the principle. was
the right ane: Germany must pay the
cost of the war up to the Hmit of her
capacity. .
“But 1 must use one word of warn-

ing.” sald Mr. Lloyd George. “We
have to-conslder the question of Ger-
many’s capacity. Whatever happens
Germany is not to be allowed to pay
her indemnity by dumping cheap
goods upon us. That is the only limit
io” the principle that we are laying
down. She must not be allowed to pay
for, her wanton damage and devasta-
tion by dumping cheap goods and
wrecking our Industries.

“There is a third and last point. Is
no one to be made responsible for the
war? Somebody has been responsible
for 0 war that has n’the lives of
millions of the best
Europe. Is mot anyone'to he made
responsible for that? If not, all 1 can
say is that if this is the case there is
one justice for the poor wretched |
criminal and another for kings and
emperors.” wh ig FR
