W. CANADA AND THE WAR.
i

John E. Ewart, of Ottawa, a stren-
uous critic of Imperialism and author
of “Kingdom Papers,” contributes to
The Canadian’ Magazine for April a
very subtle article showing that Can-
ada’s part in the war, taken freely
at her own finstance, is a tendency
towards independence. He cites for-
. meg occasions when Canada, both as
a Province and as a Dominfon, sent
aid “to the Mother Cauntry, but on
each océasfon, he points out, the ald
was sent, not 2s a duty, but with #ym-
pathy, and he adds that it always in-
volved a strengthening of the inde-
pendent spirit in Canada. This artifle
should be read by Imperialists as well
as by. those who are oppogsd to Im.
perialism.

the Government should defeat the

the fishermen and making ft almost
impossible for them to carry on a
profitable business. The Government
had quoted $c a Ib, for trout and
whitefish, the fishermen to supply the
boxes and ice for shipping purposes.
In his speech Mr. Bowman maintain-
ed that this price would not give the
fishermen a sufficient margin to make
the business profitable, after allowing
for the very heavy depreciation of

of business

Mr. Proudfoot, the Liberal leader,

WOULD EXTEND FARM DRAINAGE

Ontario Department of Agriculture
Lending Encouragement
to Scheme.

Drainage systems on Ontario farms
have proved such a hoon to agricu}-
ture in recent years, that the Depart-
ment of Agriculture is taking another
foryard step and extending this
branch of its work. The Province is
to be divided into four zones, with
qualified men in charge of each one,
who wil study soil conditions, make
sarveys, and generally do everything
possible to assist the farmers in ex-
tending this most Important work.

A branch of the Ontario Agricul
tural~ College has devoted consider

able time in the past encouraging
drainage throughout the Province.
They have had a staff of men who,
in ‘response to applications from far-
mers, surveyed the farm flelds and
supplied information as to the quan-
tity and size of tile required. The
districts into which the Province has
now been divided are arranged with
i wiew to having the sofl as near
allke in eich one as possible. The
men in charge will study the soil’ and
drainage problems of their particu-
lar districts, make surveys and gen-
erally assist the farmers in putting
in drains. Under th system that
hag been in force up until this time
the men. were only employed from
May 1st ‘until September 1st. Now
the men will be employed the year
round, and much. good {s expected to
result. -
Appointees for Surveys.

W. H. Scott, B.S.A., who succeeded
Mr. Spry In the Department recent-
ly; when the latter became Farm
Director in the Provincial Secretary's
Department,- will have this work
under his direction. His headquar-
ters for the present will be at the O,
A. Ci Guelph, but ft {a expected he
will later move, to the Parliament
Buildings, Toronto.

Appointments have already been
made for the three districts. They
are: Southern, Thomas Cooper, with
headquarters at Hamilton; sauth-
western, F. L. Ferguson, with head-
quarters at Chatham; central, L. 'G,
Helmpel, with headquarters at Guelph.
Two men remain to be appointed for
the eastern. district, which" {8 com.
posed of all of the Province east and
north of Toronto. Léss drainage is
required for land in the eastern zone,
and If these two men are not required
to spend all “thefr time there, they
will~ussist in the three western .On-
tario zones. «The district representa.
tives of the department will be ex.
pected to give every assistance in
this work.

SEED CORN ON ORDER

The amount¥of seed corn for ensil-

by Canadian dealers {s now 300,000

Jhoving been repeated to the United

view of the amount already ordered
and. the fact that orders are continu:

AND ERUPTIONS

In the Spring Most People Need a
Tonic Medicine.

One of the surest signs that the
blood is out of order is the pimples,
unsightly eruptions and eczema that
come frequently with the change
from winter to spring. These prove
that the long {indoor life of winter
has had its effect upon the blood,
and that a tonic medicine is needed
to put ft right. Indeed there are few
people who do not need a tonic at
this season: Bad blood does mot
merely show {tself in disfiguring erup-
tions. To.thisspame condition Is due
attacks of rheumatism and lumbago;
the sharp stabbing pains of sciatica
and neuralgin, poor appetite and a
desire to avoid exertion. You cannot
cure these troubles by the use of pur-
gative medicines—you need a tonic,
and a tonic only and among all
medicines there is none can equal Dr,
Willams’ Pink Pills for thelr tonic,
life-giving, nerve-restoring powers.
Every dose of this medicine makes
new, rich blood which drives out dm-
purities, stimulates every organ and
brings a. fecling of new health and
energy to weak, tired, ailing men,
women and children. If you are out
of sorts give this medicine a trial
and see how quickly It will restore
the appetite, revive drooping spirits,
and fill your veins with new, health-
giving blood. :

You can/get these pills from any

FARM VALUES,

Some {interesting figures concerning
the “Agricultural Industry of Canada
are supplied by the Dominion Statist{-
cian. The average value of farm
lands, improved and unimproved, to-
gether with all buildings that may be
on them, is approximately $44 an
acre, as compared with $41 ‘in 1916.
The Ontario average is $55.3 an acre.

The total value of live stock excels
a billion dollars. Horses account for
$479,123,000, milch cows are figured
at $274,081,000, other cattle $270,695,
000, sheep $35,776,000, and swine $92,-
886,000. There hos been a distinct
Increase in the number of animals
kept, as well as a sharp advance in
prices. The total number of cattle
and horses in Jung, 1916, was 6,594,
161, a year later it was 7,920,940.
Swine Increased from 3,474,840 to
3,619,382, HY Smal 12 :

With this increase in assets, the
farmer has been forced to meet some
increase in labilties, For example
the average wage paid to farm labor-
ers {8 $610.60 with board, as compared
with $336.29 in 1900. It is by no means
clear that the growing liability has
kept pace with the increase in assets;

FARMERS BETTER OFF.

When complaints are heard about
the high cost of living farmers decline
to accept the blame, claiming they
have to “pay more for everything”
and must charro more for their pro-
duce. This is not borne out by an
examination of the facts. The far-
mer was better off last year than he
was In 1914, before the profiteers took
advantage of the war and sent H. C.
L. on his skyward journey. Statistics
prepared by Government experts in
Washington -show that in the case of
90 commodities the farmers’ wheat
money in 1917 brought more than in
1914. Here {5 a comparative table of

FARMERS’ EXEMPTIONS
ARE REALLY LICENSES

Applications for Extension Should be
Sent in Before Expiry.

The attention of farmers receiving
conditional exeription from military
service until a fixed date {is directed
to certain principles which have been
laid down by the Central Appeal
Judge ‘at Ottawa, which apply to all
exempted men in this cinss,

The need for troops cannot: bg éx-
aggerated. On the other hand, the
necessity for maintaining food pro-
duction {8 likewise presoing. The ex.
emption granted farmers fs granted
solely because of the conviction that
they are, or may be, more useful in
food production than as troops at the
front, I

Such exemptions are really in the
nature of licenses, and aon the condl-
tion that the efforts.of the person ex-
empted for the purpose of assisting in
food production are such as to Justify
the granting’ of exemption. All such
exemptions are for a fixed period,
Hiually untf' June 1st or July 1st, but
In some cases until Nivember 1st, ~
In all'such cases the person exempt-
ed has the privilege of applying for
an extension of the exeraption perfod,
when it ought to be showhi what ef-
forts ‘the applicant has made and fg
undertaking for the greatest produc-
tion possible.

The application for extension should
be sent to the registrar at least two
weeks before tho date fixed; accom-
panied with a statement showing the
total number of acres in (he farm,
the, number of acres of arable land,
the number of acres in grain (oats,
wheat, barley, peas), the number of
acres ‘in root ‘crop; ‘number of acres
In hay, number of acres In pasture,

and raising, number of horses, sheep,

If the person fis hired help, he must

and the amount of wages paid, and a

In the case of a farmer's gon, it. will
