The Boufford and Delisle families,
former residents of Malden and Am-
herstburg, have been sorely afflicted
in Detroit during the past year. Fred.
J. Boufford spent three months, last
winter, In the sanitarjum, being treat-
ad for tuberculosis. About the middle
of March, Mrs. Louis Delisle under-
went a serious but successful Spare:
tion for the removal of tumors;
July 3rd prox. her daughter, Mise
Pearl, also was succesfully operated
upon, and last week Frank Brothers
underwent an operation for appendi-
citis; while this week Fred. Boufford,

who has never regained his strength’

has been taken to Harper hospital to
receive treatment for stomach’ troun-
bles. These families will have the
sympathy of many friends hereabouts.

Recantly a number of former pupils
of S_S. No.'s 3A and 3B met and or-
ganized the “North Malden Literary
Club” with Miss Josephine Boufford.
President; Miss Edna Coyle, Vice-
President; Miss Reta Coyle, Treas-
urer, and Miss Hilda Burns, Librarian.
The club has ambitious aspirations in
the way of literary progress. and so-

eiability among its members and in

thébcommunity at large. They have
undertaken a patriotic concert to be
given In the stone schoolhouse, Gravel
Road, some time In August, and are
hasy rehearsing for a very humorous
play entitled: “Jones vs. Jinks.” Full

particulars will appear in these coi-
umns in due time. =

For a beautiful scenic driveway, the
river front road fs just about the
poorest example of a thoroughfare in
Essex county, and deserves better of
Malden council than it is getting. The
long drouth-and large amount of motor
traffic over it, this summer, has cut
the sand up and it now is so rutty
that passing motors are In absolute
