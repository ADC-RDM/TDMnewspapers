season Ruth Thomas made [kai |

| Jp Curios decorations,
Is was why the people ie
called her the dns Je oF intl
The day before Christmns Ruth sat |

{In her little shop finishing the last

wreath she would make that season.

“There!” she said, deftly twisting a
sprig of bright red berries among the
evergreen stems, “that finishes Helen
Stunwood's order, and thank goodness
it’s done in time. Oh, dear!" she sighed,
lnying the wreath aside, “I do wish I
could spend one Christmas time en-

has not been unyone here over the holi-
dnys since I can remember, and I hive
i not been to a Christmas party In years
| —not since the time I went over to
Dolly Blair's with Dane.”

A warm color suddenly glowed In the
| glel's cheeks and there was a soft light
in her brown eyes as she thought of
| that memorable night.

Dane Stanwood had taken her to
that party. Once during the cvening

he had suddenly appeared In. Brierly
with the blue racing car. Soon It Was
rumored that he had made a fortune
in the mines.

The second week after his return
Stanwood bought the old Blain wman-
sion and gave the Information that he
intended to staove Into his new home
before Christmas. Next he finnounced
thot preparations were under wa¥y for
a perty’ which he was giving Christ-
mns eve.

The evergreen girl liad been sur-
prised and a little bit Lurt because
Dane had not even called. She had
thought 1t strange, too,dut first, that
she did not recelve an Invitation to
the party, for she knew nensly every:
one in Brierly was going.

But when Ruth was told the party
wis to be given in honor of Stunwood's
flancee, she understood why she had
not been Invited.

“That Isavhy Helen Stanwood didn’t
mention the party. when she ordered
these wreaths,” Ruth thonght, as she |
began tying them together. “Of course,
I would not go anyway now. My, but

The evergreen girl was so busy gets
ting the Stanw ood order ready that she
did not notice that the blue roadster
had returned and stopped by the gate,
Neltlier “did she observe the brond-
shouldered young man who was striding

“well, rhaps I cansgo. for a little

And I realy ought to hélp Dane and
his sister ent, for they have been suck
good custaners.”

Dine whered Ruth into the big
double parors of his new home, where
the Christnas tree had been placed.

“Do yen suppose,” he asked, polnt-
ing to n great pile of evergreen at one
end of )¢ room, “we will be able to
hang all these wreaths and then deco
rate the tree before elght o'elqek ?”

The evergreen girl gave a merry it~
tle langh. o

“] om sure we can If we work fast,”
she apswered. “I am used to this
work, you know, and with your help
it won't take long.”

“How long have you been the ever-
green girl?” Dane asked, ns he and
Ruth were trimming a chandeller.

This 1s my third season,” Ruth re
plied: “I found that there was a big
demnnd for wrenths and laurel trim-
ming during the Christmas holidays,
so three years ngo I opened gn ever-
green shop. I love to do this kind of

“Work, and although the season is a

short one, my little shop pays well,”

The evergreen girl might have added
that, more than this, the rush of work
just at Christmas time helped her to
forget the dull ache (n her heart which
wns always so hard to bear during the
holidays. She sald nothing of this,
though, but asked, instead:

“Toll me, Dane, how you have spent
Christmas while you have been awny.
Have you been svhera there was much
merry-making?'*

“For the past three years,” sald
Stanwood, “I've celebrated Christmas
by working from dawn till dark. This
is the first enjoyable Christmas eve 1
nave known since I left Brierly."

“It ‘has been a very pleasant eve-

[ning for me, too,” said Ruth, “and I

have enjoyed it everf@ko much: Now.
we'll trim the Christmas tree, and then
you, ean’ .take me home and get back
in time forsthe party.”

At half-past seven Dane surveyed

With the help, of the evergreen girl he
tind finished the decorations and every-
thing was in readinéss for the guests.
“The rooms look just ag they did
four years ago at Dolly Blair's Christ-
mas tree—even the mistletoe bough,”
sald Dane. “Don't you remember how
that one hung right over our heads, as
this one does now?" oo
The evergreen girl was silent. 4
“Hnd you forgotten, Ruth?’ he per
sisted.
““No,” softly, “I' had not forgotten.”
“You never thought I had forgotten,
did you, dear?’
“But you never wrote, Dane.”
“Beenuse for a long time I was miles
from n rallrond or pest office and could
not send any mail. But I've thought
of that night, though, and all these
years I've been planning to have a

“But Isn't the friend who is coming
with Helen Your flancee?” faltered
Ruth.

“Not exactly,” laughed Dane. “That
friend Is Harry North, Helen's flance.
