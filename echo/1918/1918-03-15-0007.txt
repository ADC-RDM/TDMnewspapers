land applies to-American citizens no
matter where they reside: It is felt
the redress for Americans living in

The department takes the ground that
residents of Canada working in the
United States, whether American clti-
zens or not, should pay the Dominion
income tax. No ruling has as yet been
made as to Americans who work in
