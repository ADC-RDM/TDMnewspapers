TRAGEDY OF THE LAKE,

 

The finding of the drowned pody of
a handsome woman about 40 years of
age on W. G. Baldwin's beach Tues:
day afternoon reveals one of those
tregedles that ogeur from time to
time from sudden”storms coming up
and swamping small gasoline launches
on Lake Erie. The body was attired
only. in underclothing and a fur coat,
with Hfe preserver upon which was
painted the name Gracjel II. Detroit,
which proved the means of identifica-
tion. Dr. Mackenzie, , coroner, was
called and after viewing the remains
advised Mr. Madill to place the hody
in the little morgue at Erle cemetery
until Inquiries could be set afloat. The
Echo ‘got in touch with the marine
editor of tiie Detroit News, who ascer-
tained Wednesday afternoon that the

wade), aged 40. of Willow Beach, East
Petroit. Her husband owns that bath-
ing beach. Friday the unfortunate
woman, her son Harold and his friend
Albert Walan, set out In the 21-foot
gasoline launch Graceil II to shoot
ducks, along the American shore, in-
tending to return Sunday. After that
nothing more was heard ‘of them until
the body washed dshore here, telling
fn no uncertain way’ that the flerce
storm of Friday and Saturday had
swamped ‘their araft and all the occu-
pants perished in the waters of Lake
Erie. The finding of an upholstered
chair on the beach, lettered the same
as the life preseérver confirms this
opinion, A-close watch is being main-
tained for the bodies of the boys,
which are bound to come ashore here-
abouts.

The husband of the deceased woman
ent to Harrow on Wednesday night,
arranged for sliipping the body to De-
troit, and” also for a patrol on the
shore to recover the bodies of his son
and the other young mam.

first view. of a congrete vessel Satur-
day night, when the tug Harding stop-
