RICH, RED BLOOD

Its Victims are Largely mang Weak,

In {he epidemic of 1a  grippe, OF
influenza, that has swept over Tan
ada, fn common with the Fest of the
world, i has hash noticeable that its |)
tarliesi victims, wére the hid
blooded andemic people whose power
of resistance Is greatly weakened nes
cause of the watery condition of their
bload When person sy strong,
hearty,” able to ‘enjoy a brisk cold
day, chills’ and “infections are set at

a

defiance.y But when the system |s
run down, when the nerves are
shaky and the blood” watery, the
germs of Influenza are’ quick to
sejze their opportunity. * It is there-
foré good policy to keep the blood

always rich, red and strong, and the
nerves well nourished by the use of
such a reliable tonic as Dr. Williams"
Pink Pills. + People who take ‘these
pills from ume to time are usually
able. to resist colds, Influenza and
other , allments, “ and enjoy - good
health while many about them are
weak, allfng and miserable.

To those who have been attacked
by “influenzh, the after effects’ are
more dangerous than the attack-it
self. They®are left at the mercy of
Lrelapses and wcomplications. There
is a persistent weakness of the limbs,
shortness of breath at the least ex-
ertion, poor digestion and a tendency
to fake cold easily. This condition
will persist and will RTOW WOTSe un-
Tass the blood is bullt up and the
shattered nerves strengthened. For
this purpose there {8 no" tonit can
equal Dr. Willlams¢' Pink Pills. From
first to last dose these pills make
new, rich, red blood. which reaches
every organ and every nerve In the
body. Thus the lingering germs
are driven out. the appetite fs im-
proved, and: weak, despondent vie-
tims of Influenza are transformed
into cheerful. healthy, happy men
and women. If you have passed
through am attack of influenza you
will find Dr. . Williams’ Pink Pills
the one thing needed to restore you
to full health and strength. If the
trouble has passed you, you ean
further strengthen yourself aeainst
its Insidious advance by the use of
he pe tanie medicine.
Medicine dealers everywhere sell

Suffered Since
Childhood
Kidneys at the Root of the Evil

Think of it! The j The joys of youth
marred by agonizing pains, and all
hopes of a bright future blotted out
by thoughts of a life burdened with
Backache and other sufferings.

Such was the case of Mr. A. Cail
until a good friend advised him that
there was a remedy for his trouble
and he would find it if he used Gin
Pills. Read what Mr. Cail says:

“I was troubled with my Kid-
neys since childhood and on [3
large amount of money on doe-
tors trying to get cured. Instead
of getting better 1 kept getting
worse until a friend of mine ad-
vised me to try Gin Pills I did
80, and after taking one box 1 was
able to get out of bed and walk
around. Two more boxes relieved
me completely and since then I
have had no return of the trouble.”

This - remarkable testimonial was
written by a man whose statement ean-
not be doubted. Mr. Cail's reason for
writing this history of his case was—
gratitude for the relief that Gin Pills /
brought him. Wouldn't you do the
eame if your case was similar! If you
suffer now—don't suffer any longer.
Use Gin Pills and obtain relief from

pain, suffering and inconvenience that
