School opening September 3rd draws near, and mothers are think-
ing of necessary wearables—it requires some cogitation these days

to find what one wants at suitable price. A perusal of the following
list will offer some suggestions.

‘Dress Fabries in Wool and Cotton ¢

We have still some pretty, attractive wool materials for the mak-
ing of blouses and dresses—serges and fancy weaves. A little work
and effort will sometimes effect quite a saving on a garmen nt—ready

made.
We have good assortments of cotton fabrics as well—ginghams,

percales, plain weaves, and fancy work

Dresses-- Ready ly Made

Lots of good ones to be picked np. Cotton dresses such as
hams and prints, which will do for several months of fall we

and pretty garments can be had for a a 1 » outlay, We hav
up to 14 and 16 years. And some exc t sarge dresses, ¢ kind
which will wear and wash—in navy, b k and a few other colors. Any
of these garments are away cheaper than our fall offerings will be,
so now is the logical time to purchase. Sizes are broken, but yet
plenty for nearly all needs.
