The Victory Loan is a bridge
over which the farmers of Can-

ada drive their hogs their cae;
their surplus

crops to the profitable British

their grain and al

market,

For, the money raised by the
Victory Loan enables Canada
to.give credit to Great Britain.
And only by means of that cred-
it can Great Britain buy the
products of Canada’s farms.

Therefore, when you come for
ward at your country’s call and
loyally lend your money that
Canada may continue her vig-
orous prosecution of the war,
you are also “benefitting -your-

self and the whole farming
community.

It is the duty of every earncst
Canadian not only to. invest
heavily in Victory Bonds 1918,
but to work among his neigh-
bors to make the loan a success.

Before the subscription lists
close, every man should realize
the sterling character of the
investment;. the good interest
return of 54%; the undoubted
security offered in the Bonds of
this wealthy nation; and the
vital importance to all classes of
people, particularly to the farm-
ers, of the Victory Loan 1918.

co-operation with the Minister of Finance of

FISHERIES INCREASE IN VALUE.
An increase of $13,143,666 in the
market value of Canadian fisheries
during 193%, as compared with 1916, is
shown by a statement issued by the
Dapartment of the Naval Service. The
statement shows that: the total mar
ket value of Canadiin, fisheries for
1917 was $62.352.044, to which total
the seas fisheries contributed $4,062,
605 and the inland Hsheries $6,299,439.
The two Provinces ‘which « chiefly
shawed increases were British Colum-
bia and Nova Scotia. The fisheries of
the former reached a total value of
$21,668,695, which was $6,921,249 great-
er than the total for 1916. The fig-
ures for Nova Scotin were $14,465,319
