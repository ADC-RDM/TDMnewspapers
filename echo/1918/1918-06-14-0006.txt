While ploughing on his farm near
Brantford, James Balley tunred up
the body, of a  tweo-yearold white
child, which was perfectly normal in
every respect and which had. appar-
ently ‘been buried within a very re-
cent time. The body was wroaped
in cptton and newspapers. whlch the older sort, known ashe

. “beam” trawl has almost disappeafed

About twenty-five years ago the
