Week, watery blood is the starting
point of consumption. When your
blood Is in this condition your whole
health declines. Your face becomes
pale or sallow; your appetite fails, your
heart jumps and flutters at the least
exertion or excitement. You are al
ways weak and wretched and, you lose
interest in both work and amusement.
This is the point from which you may
easily” step Into that hopeless decline
that leads to consumption and the
grave. What {8 needed to bring back
