A Reliable Car
Perhaps the highest merit in a motor car is
trustworthiness. And it is with this important

consideration in mind that we recommend the
Gray-Dort car.

It is powerful well able to carry you to your
destination without faltering.

It is speedy—above the full extent of your

     

L

way motor.

It is  comfortable—comfortable in room and in smooth riding,
sprung and cushioned for bad roads as well as good, That no
other car ofits weight and price is so comfortable, is our belief;

But above all the Gray-Dort is reliable. Trouble,

to most motcrists, is avoided by a minute and
construction, a high standard of raw materials,

to details;

i are the things that will eventually win you to the
ort. !

The new Gray-Dort embodies all the good features that won instant suc-
cess: for former models. The 4cylinder motor is a triumph of smooth,
economical speed and power. The chassis is sturdy and quict. The springs
are long. The upholstery is deep. The equipment is absolutely complete
from electric starting and lighting to the tools. New lines of beauty have
been given this model.

The five-passenger touring

5 $1,050; the Gray-Dort special, beautifully finished, and with extra details
equipment, is $125 above the list. All prices are f-0.b. Chatham,
