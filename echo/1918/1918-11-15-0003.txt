THE PRODUCTIC! AND
APPLICATION OF ANTI- ®
HOG HHOLERA SERUM
(Frank Hawkns. Pltman-Moore
Co, irvice lepartment.)

Hog cholera fs (i¢ commonest and
most highly, contajlous disease that
affects swine. No brad of hogs Is lm-
mune to jt. The death rate from this
disease Is go great that fi constitutes
one of the most serious Sources of
losses Affecting the agricytural indus-
try of the United States

Causes.—Hog chollii {gx @used by
the presence in the blood of & Virus
or poison, the exact nature of Which
has never been determined, ag glence
has not yet succeeded in separh'NE
this virus from the other elements In
the blood. This virus-cannot be geen
by the microscope, ang the elementd
of which ft Is composed are so infin
Itesimally small that they pass freely
through the finest filter,

This. filterable virus is found not
only In the blood of every hog that Is

ted with cholera, buat fn the
fmces, the urine, and fe arly all the
body tissues

The only way in an animé!

in contract hog cliolera Is by actu!
contact with this virus le. many b#
Nafs thut the disease Is caused by such

as eating green corn, tho use of

ete, are entirely wrong. Such
conditions may bring about lessened
resistance to the disease, but a grnu-
Ine case of hog cholera can occur Anly
after the hog has come In contact with
the cholera virus, and has taken some
of the virus into its own system.

How the Diseass Spreads —HOgE
cholera may be transmitted fn a pum:
ber of wavk: by direct contact of one
agmal with wnather; ins ping (ui

or feeding troughs; by birds, by
streams, by dogs and parasites; -on

infected food. Jt 18 most frequently

ntHated or unsanitary qucrters are
it readily infected, and they offei

the causative agent to remote fields,
where they communicate it to healthy

plague from stock-yard to stocy rd. |

Practically all public stock-yurds are |
infected with cholera. as are all pub-
lic feeding pens and rest stations pro-
Wded by common carriers for the nc-
commodation of hogs in- transit

§ There is always n probability of in-
faction at public fairs and stock
shows, and none but immune animals
should~be sent to such places for ex
hibition purposes. After returning
from an. exhibition sueh. animals
should be quarantined. for at least
thirty days before being permitied to

The Application of the Serum Treat

result of og cholera. There are two
methods of employing the* treatment;
known as the serum aloneyor “single”
method, and the simultafieous or
“double” method Each of these
methods “hasyits advantages and
disadvantages: The serum alone
method possesses the advantage of
being absolutely safe, in that it cannot
by any possibility cause spread of the
disease, and does not require any ex-

traordinary care of the animals after |

treatment, Its ‘disadvantage lies In
the' fact thar the mmunity produced

must be borne in mind, however, that

most dangerous and destructive agent
when allowed to escape from the coo
trol of 1ts master. A
The administration of the simultane-
ous treatment should pot be under
taken except by competent .vatorin-
arfans, who have had special Lealnizs
in this particular line. These oper-
ators must understand how to corrnet-
Iy gauge the dosage of serum and
virus for different Animals; aud their
judgment on this point must be based
on the physical condition of each fg.
dividual. animal, and the canditioiie
under which the herd is kept, as wuli
4s on the size and weight of the ani-
mals that are treated. They must
understand how to prevent the escape
of any of the virus, and how to do-
stroy {ts dangers by careful disinfect-
tion, shonld any virus be accidentally
spilled or escape from needle wounds
in the treated animal. They must ba
able to give the hog owners full and
definite Instructions about feading
and caring for thelr hogs before and’
after treatment, and it Is the owrar's
(duty to himself and his herd to ob
sorve such instructions carefully. All
of these things are necgssary pails
