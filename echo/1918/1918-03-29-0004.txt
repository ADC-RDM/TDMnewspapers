was born on the lake front, Colchester
South. Otthe family three are living:
Peter Hutchins, of.-Mersea; James, of |"
Cleveland, and Mrs. Willlam Gegler,
of St. John's; Mich, all of whom were
in attendance at his bedside during his
last dllness and also at the funeral. Mr.
Hutchins: attained manhood in Col
chester South, and was married there
forty-six" years ago to Elizabeth Best.
Shortly afterwards they purchased the
farm on the Creek Road, Malden,
which he later sold to his brother, the
Iate Silas Hutchins, and purchased
the John Parks place, on which he
died. He was-@ thrifty, hard working
farmer, having a remarkable cdpac-
ity for management, and his beautiful
farm with its fine modern residence,
barn and outbuildings are monuments
to his Industry; most of it was cleared
from the solid wood, and all tile drain-
ed. To Mr. and Mrs. Hutchins were
born two children—Auna May (Mrs,
Georgo Sellars) and Maurice, on the
homestend., She died two years ago
March 2nd. A yoar ago {n the. winter
he was taken very {ll and underwent
a serious. operation In Detroit, spend-
ing oleven weeks in tho hospital. He
never fully recovered from that, and
last January, while attending a poul-
try show In Windsor, suffered stroke,
but managed to reach home, and while
lie rallied, paralysis gradually crept
on, causing fis death. The funeral
took place Sunday afternoon; a short
service was held at the house by Rev.
Mr. Snell, after which the remains
‘wore taken to Chirat church, Colches-
