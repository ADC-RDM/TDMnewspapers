BY-LAW No.

A By-Law to provide for Drainage Work in the. Township of Colchester South, in the
County of Essox, and for borrowing on the credit of ghe Municipality the sum of
Four Hundred’ and Ninoteen Dollars and Thirty Cents for compfBting the same.
Provisionally adopted the 4th day of February, A. D, 1918. A

Whereas the majority in number of the resident and non-resident owners (exclusiy
of farmers’ sons not actual owners), as shown by the last revised Assessment Roll,
tlie property heleinafter set forth to be benefitted by drainage work, that Is to say,
by constructing a tile drain along Queen Street in the Village of Harrow, have petitions
ed the Council of the 4. Township ofColchester South praying that the lands on thé
East side of Queen Street In the Village of Harrow, from Munger Avenue to the PDilip
Ferriss Drain, x be drained by means of a Tie Drain. i

And where. thereupon the sald Council has procured an examination to be made
by Ji. J. Nowman, being a 'persc ompetent [OR such purpose, of the sald area pro-

osod to be drained, and tho suggested foruthe drainage thereof, and of other
ands and roads liable to assessment under the Municipal- Drainage Act, and has also
procured plans, specifications and estimates of the dralpage work to be made by the
sald J, J. Newman and an assessment 10 be made by hith of the Japds and roads to bo
benefitted by such drainage work, and of other lands and roads liable for contribution
thereto, stating as nearly as ho can the proportion of benefity” outlet liability and Injur-
ink lability which, In hls opinion, will be derived or-incurred in consequence of such
drainage work by every road and lot, or portion of lot, the sald a<Sessment So made
being the sment hereinafter by this by-law enacted to besassessed and levied upon
the roads lots, or. parts GF lots, hereinafter in that behalf specially sel forth and
described; d the report of the-sald J. J. Newman Ih respect. thereof, and of the sald

drainage work being as follows
Windsor, Ont., October 29th, 1017.

To the Redve and Municipal Council of the Township of Colchester South:—

Gentlemen,—In compliance with your instructions, I have made an examindtion,
survey, report, ete,, of tho drain petitioned for by Thomas Vincent amd others, and now
report theron as follows:

1 commenced my survey at the Philip Ferriss Drain on the Eastside of Queen Street,
Thence I followed ong the East side of Queen Street to the Northerly. side of-Munger
Avenue, in the Police Village of Harrow. d

I find that there IS at present a 12° tlle drain from the Philip Ferriss Drain (6 a
point about feet south thereof at the catch basin near the ine between the lands of
Gordon Arner and W. H. Ferriss, From the last mentioned point to tho Southerly side
of Sinasac Avenue there has been a 7‘ tile drain constructed, but thts ast yntioned
drain 1s so shallow and so poorly that it, In Tact, 18 of, very little henent to the
Jand$ it was intended to drain, and af a consequence the lands Soujh of the Pere Mar-
quette Nallway are flooded with every small freshet that comes,

In order.to overcome this dimeulty, and thus afford proper draifidge to the lands
and roads affected.” would recommend that a 12 tlle drain be constructed from the
catch basin near the line between the lands of Gordon Arner and W. H. Ferriss to the
catch basin at the Southerly side of Sinasac Avenue, and a 7" tile drain be constructed
from the last mentioned point to-1ho uSstherly side of Munger avenue, all as shown on

NA.
ssary to construct a drain under the tracks of
sewer crock lald In goncrete, as shown on the

wtf

the accompanying profile and specifica

I further find that It will bo
the Pere Marquette Rallrosd with
accompanying profile, . " 4

"estimate the cost of construeting this portion of the drain at the sum of 8150,00,
1 estimate the cost of constructing 12‘ farm tile drain for the same distance at the
sum of 813.80, making a difference in cost, the sum of 8136.20. This last mentioned
amount Ishave pssed against the Pere Marquette Rallroad Company to be barne and
contrbuted by it in case it does not, exereise (1s option of constructing the said drain
within a reasonable time and without unnecessary delay.

Should the Radway Company construct the drain under the tracks above men-
tioned, then the Township will ay to the sald Company she sum of $13.80,

My estimate of the cost of the wholo of the above work, together with all inci-
dental ‘expenses, except the Pere Marquette Railroad crossing, IS tne sum of 8410.30.
Of this amount I have assessed the lands which,are benefitted by or use the said drain
As an outlet, with the sum of $286.00, and the Township of Colchester South: for roads
with the. sum of $133.30, as more fully set forth In the scheduld of assessment
hereto attached. ’ - )

1 would further recommend that this drainage work be kept up and maintained at

tho expense of the lands and roads herein assessed for its construction, and In the pro-»

Boi ani #ain contained until otherwise determined by the report of an engineer undep
the provisiing of the Municipal Drainage Act,
Accompanying this report you will ind a copy of this report, plans.and specifica-
tions for thie purpese of securing the Spproval of the Rallway Comission; shiuld it bo
found nectiggrysfo ure such approval before the Pere Marquette Railway will con-
struct the Girain under thelr tracks.
All of ‘which Is respectfully submitted.

(Signed) 1.7. NEWNAN,

142 over his opponent, Hance Logan.
Tho Provinces in which the votes
have go far been sounted aro. Ontarlo,
Quobec and Nova Scotia.

The effect of the vote In the two
former provinces has been compara-
tively insignificant, only one Ontario
seat having really been endangered. In
Quebec it {s doubtful whether even the
oversens vote will create any differ-
ences. In Novi Scotia, however, the
soluiers’ vote of this side has shorn
down several Liberal majorities to a
point where the overseas soldiers’ vote
will almost assuredly wipo them out.

Seven Changes: Likely.
From presont indications there will

be seven changes, including the elec-
tion of Mr. Speaker Rhoces, Liberals
who aro almost ceripin to bo defeated
include OMver in West Edmonton, At-
kinnin South Eapse#, McKav in Pictou,
Martel In Hants, ¢arrol in Richmand
and South Cape Breton, and probably
Kyte in the same ¢oAgstituency, though
he still has a fair lead over his oppon-

ents, ;
The soldiors’ vor? averaged about 85

per cent. for the Government. Ia Nova
Scotia, however, there was a greater
[proportion for the Opposition than in
the other Province. In North Cape
Breton, for instance, D. D. Mackenzie,
the Laurier candidate, sceured 77 sol-
dier votes to McCarmaclk's 108, which
is nearly 60 per cent. of the tutal, !
Interesting Results. |
Among the interesting results in
Ontario are South Essex, whero Atkin |
has a precarious riajority over Brien:
The Laurier candidate secured 14
votes and Brien 38; . North Essex,
whero Kennedy, the Laurier candidate, |
has at present a majority of over 600, {
sécured 56 votes and Wigle 310; North |
Waterloo, where Waeiclhel, the defeat- |
ed Government eandidute, secured 100,
and Euler, who has aliready majority,
got only 7; West Middlesex, where
Ross, the Laurier camdidate, hod 18
votes, ns against 66 scoured by Elliott,
the defeated Government candidate;
South Perth, whero Dr. Stecleethe
Government candidatie, secured 61
votes as against 4 for Forester; North
Brant, where Cockshutt secured 10
votes and Harold, the defeated Gov-
ernment candidate, 38; South Oxford,
where Sutherland sewured 54 and
Schell 8; South Waterlom, where Scott
secured 1562 and Thwmpson 9; North
Oxford. where Col. Southerland se

cured 39 and Nesbitt ‘58; North Ren- |

frew, where Blackie secured 92 and
Reid secured 11; South Renfrew,
whero Major Martin got 76 and Ped-
low-got 12, and Nortih Ontario, where
Col. Sharpe secured 45 and his oppon-
ent, Hogg, got not a single onc.

-London, Gibbons, the Opposition
candidate securod 1.28 votes as against
769 polled for his opponent, Cronyn.

It is interestin® to mote = that in
North Wellington, wherq Clark, the
Conservative, was not cndorsed, the
letter secured 54 votes marked. for
him personally; in Welland, where no-
apd was endoroed, Fraser secired 106

{08 and German 44, with 143 votes
rejected, and in Kept, where nobody
was endorsed, McColg secured 29 votes
and Plowes 49, with 108 votes reject
ed. ‘In sedts ‘where there was no en-
dorsation only ballots marked person-
ally for the candidates countd.

The Quebe Poll.

In Quebec ‘the soldiers’ voto poled
{n Canada had no apprecinibe cffect
on the present standing. In Brome,
wirore McMartin, the Laurier candi-
date, is leading by QUO “St present,
Draper, his opponent, secured 55 sol
diers’ votes: and McMartin secured 6.

In Chambly-Vercheres, where up-
wards of 1,200 soldiers’ votes were
“located” Rainville, the Government
candidate, and former _deputy-speaker,
could only squecze oiit 127 after the
onvelopes had been sorted and the
ballots counted, while. his victorious
‘opponent, Archmambanlt, secured 10.
Both’ Messrs. Sevigny and Blondin are
in ‘a hopeless condition.

In Kings, N. S., Sir Robert Borden
yBecured 100 votes as against 22 for
Seely. In Richmond and South Cape

candidate, has still .66 of a majority
