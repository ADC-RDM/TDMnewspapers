response fs Anticipated.

 

Within a FW days mord will ba pub:
lished an Official announcement

throughout (»¢ Dominion that men of
19 years of Age are not to be called
up for miliary service immediately.
The announvement will state that no
date has beeh fixed for the calling up
of these meth nor has the question
been. brought! before the Cabinet for

decision: .

 

The annual statement of the Work. |

men's Compensation Board just {ssued
shows that during=1917 the lotal am-
ount of compensation awarded. was
£3:917,085.81, "08 compared with $2.-
011,468.94 {in 1916. The average am-
ount of compensation per day during
1917 was $4,071. Assessments wore
collected from 14,000 employers on a
payroll representing $256,680,000. The
total numbed of aceldents  raported
was 36,514, ms agaist 26,092 reported
during the pirevioul year.

rd

A foeler lia been sent out from Ot-
tawa regardiing the intention of the
Government (Ao impose “price fixing"
throughout, tthe couptry very soon.
The inspired! despatch says: “That
| price-fixing, which “shall be general
throughout the Dominion, cannot be
long delayedl. 18 a theory that is gain.
ing ground. The declared intention’
of the United States food administra-
tion. to fix prices in all departments
of food supplly to protect the consumer
fs an examplle which is almost bound
to be found iin Canada,"

 

 

About thé most, drastic draft enact-
ment yet adwpted by Canada and the
United States is the “Alien draft con-
vention,” nww before the American
Senate for mdoption. Roughly &peak-
ing the drafft rules of each country
now-apply (to the citizens of each
‘country wheither at home or abroad.
A Britisher;, Canadian or American
can be draftted whether he Is in Eng-
land, Cannadia or the United States,
and he has jjust two months to decide
whether to enlist or be drafted. The
age limit {8 #4 years.

BASEBALL,

 

 

This great summer’ outdoor sport
has the whoje town of Amherstburg by
the ears, and scarco a night goes by,
except Saturdays. and. Sundays, but
crowds of people from” not only the
jtown but surrounding disiricts con-
gregate on. the town, park to cheer
on their respective champlons! Sclen-
tific’ points are not overlooked even
in the unimportant gamos, and um-
pires®have to be mighty careful in
thelr decisions if they do not wish to
be “boohed” off the fleld, The result
is the development of ball teams from
which later in the season a nine can
be selected whieh will clean up any
amateur club in the Southwestern
peninsula while big leagues can easily
secure excellent timbers for any new
umpires they may require when Silk
O'Laughllir and Billy Evans are no
more. ; ng

The standing of the teams in the
local league up to Wednesday night
in as follows :— :

Outside the regular league gnmes,
two interesting contests wore pulled
off. Thursday "and Saturday nights.
The former was between a team of
All Stars, chosen by Si."Bertrand, ard
the Amherstburg Regularf for a side
bet. The Regmlars had the A. Stars
beaten 10 to 4_ut the ‘end of five jn-
nings wien “rain stopped the game.
The dUestion of paying bets was re-
ferred ta the sporting cditor of the
Detroll Free: Press, who sald it was
too deop for him to solve and pagsed
it on to Ban Johnson, President Amer-
jcan League. - Saturday. the Regulars
defeated the fast team: from (he Steel
Col poration, Ojibway, in a nine-inning
game, 12 to 3. The ganie was too one-
sided to be as interesting as some of
tha bouts between local. tenms.. An-
other biz game (8 scheduled for Sat-
urday afternoon betweén Windsor A.
