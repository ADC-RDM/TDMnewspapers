Then, 88 spring came on, the cop-
gressma® became more than ordifarily
pensive, Even at the capitol it was
commen(¢d on that Pragg had some’

*~ Perhaps the single affiction of being
dumb without being deaf is not a rare
die, but In Washington on the Sunday
(that this advertisement appeared in
the local papers, women so handi-
capped were not numerous. Or, If
they’ were, they were not stenogra-

Stenography was good enough
0 the congressunan's young-
man secretary—who sized them up
when they came to the ofMice—In refer-
ring her to the congressinan himself.
That was Mardy Mapes, mnd she was
not entirely what the congressman had
usked for in the andvertlsiement. She
admitted to the secretary In writing,
on the small tablet of paper that she
carried around with her, thint she was
under thirty, and anyone could hove
told at a glance that she wasni't even
twenty-five, “However,” she wrote to
the congressman when he olijjécted to
her on the score of extreme syouthful-
ness; “I am old In my wmys and I
can logk much older if I dress In plain
dark clothes.”

The congressman frowned a little
at her to show his disapmroval, but
consoled himself with thee thought
that If he kept her In his exmploy long
enongh, she would eventuallly reach n
sultnble age. On general ‘principles,

ple pvhispered that this was because of

those who knew him better knew that

a poor -farmer's boyy to the leading
man of his state, theere had been no
time. for “filrtation ow love-making.

“You “may consldier yourself em-
ployed,” sald .the congressman, and
the smile that came oveer Mardy's face
showed that she hesird perfectly In
spite of her total dumibness. “Now, I

Although the ambitious young man

bad the distinction of being his sees

“I hive something to tell you,” he

Seen that she started and then turned
perceptibly paler. She made no writ-

The congressman looked pensive
and grave, Very tenderly and, trying
to conceal his own disappointment, he
told Mardy of the speclalist’s verdict
—that, strangely. -enough, Mardy's
speechlessness- was | incurable: This
time the congressman studied Mardy's
face, hut ft showed: nothing save a
studied immobility.

They both tried to go back to the
work of the day, but unsuccessfully,
and then the congressman broke the
silence. “I'll have to tell you what fs

sald. “I'll tell you, and then you ean

Necessary Farm
~~ Equipment’:

ORE and more the Ford ear is looked
upon by progressive farmers as neces-
sary fagm equipment, the same as.the

low, the hay-rake, the drill, the mower, the
Dion and other labor and time-saving
machinery, :

A farmer with a Ford car can dis with
one or two of his horses and make the trips to-
town, railway station, creamery, or to the neigh-~
boursin one-third the time. In fact there is no
farm machine made that will save the busy
farmer and his busy wife so much valuable time
as a Ford. And it’s so easy to take cage of —far
easier than a horse. No bed to make, or hay and
oats to get, no harnessing and unharnessing, and
no stables to clean. The Ford practically takes,
care of itself.

Ask any farmer who owns a Ford if he would
ever again try to get ‘along without it. His
answer will hasten your decision to own one.
