Cassandra Andrews had one every-
thing she could think of. Shi had worn
her most becoming blouses! and her
mst stockings—she had spant hours
doling her halr and brushing her eye-
brows and-pelishing her nails, but a
whole gehool year had almost disposed
of itself and (he young professor of
English liternture had never seemed to
notice her ant all, Before and after
class he joked and jollled with other
girls. The vivaclous Roberta Stevens
nearly always stopped af hig desk for
a moment of chatter—Berths Marvin,
the cluss beauty, the athletic Agnes
Burns and a dozen others were op the’
friendliest terms with him, but Cas-
sandra Andrews slipped .demurelly into
her sent four mornings a week, appar-
ently unnoticed.

“They're nll crazy atbout him,” she
thought scornfully, as she watched the
professor's reception before class one
morning. “Every single one of them!”

After the professor had delivered his
lecture that morning, there was a gen-
eral discussion and he called on her

little statement of disagreement with
the generally accepted theory. And
right there js where the professor
made his first mistake. He smiled 2
tolerant, skeptical sort of smile, the
trend of which Cassandira Andrews
cnught (immediately, and she leaned
forward Impetuonsly andi /flatly contra-
dicted: his comment. Then she fol-
lowed up the contradiction: with a tum-
ble of words in support of lher own
opinion and sat speedily down mgain.

The professor was surprised. “Well,”
he sald, crisply. “I'm glad {that at
least one student in the class thinks
for herself. , I was afrald you were all

On the Instant the belll rang and the
girls ardse and passed out in chatter

outside with lightt-hearted banter.

“We're all sheep but you,” Andy,
dear,” sang out Edman Phray, dancing
up to Cassandra deilightedly. “And you
are a blessed lamih, but you'll grow. I
never knew you hind so much spunk.
Where do you keep it?"

And the two of throm strolled off to-
gether, arranging: ‘to play tennis in the
late, afternoon. Later that day the
professor of Englisih and his crony, the
professor of economics, sought the
courts for their regular afternoon's
tennis bout.” The Engliish professor
patted a ball aimlessly /into the net
while his contemporary changed his
shoes.

PUZZLED BY QUEER NAMES

Writer Finds It Hard to Understand
Why Parents “Impose Burden”
on Their Children.

 

What extraordinary nnmes some
people are compelled to- bear, , or:
choose to assume! TI hesitate to call
them “Christian names,” because they
aren't Christian, very often. “Given

nomes” |s_ perhaps the better way of |=

describing them. * Perhaps, you have
heard of the Irishman assisting at a
baptism, who, when he heard the god-
mother answer “Hazel” to the ques-
tion as to the child's name, broke
forth: “For the love of hiven! the
whole calendar ls full of the names
of blessed female saints, and they do
be callin’ the baby after a nut!”

I thought of that when L Iboked
through the catalogue of a girly’ col
lege thejother dny, and noted these
labels: Golde Mane, Fura, Arvilla,
Kathryn, Elva, Melba, Izer, Neva, Ra-
monn, Mabelle, Vidah, Esta. Millis,
Mayme, Mable, Arthetta, Lilyan, Bu-
nh, Arbita, Narmie, Ara, Jonnie, Roxa,
Zurelle, Zullene, Vanja, Mote, Corébnn.
Tt was a comfort to get back to Brid-
get nnd Margaret! Names are not ar-
bitrary combinations of jvowels and
consonants; they: have, or should
have, significance, n historic setting, a
personal and family relationship, that
dignifies them.

To invent fantastic labels for pet
dogs may be allowed; but human be
ings ought not to be put on that levek
So, misspellings of familiar names,
Christian or family, seem either undig-
nified or ignofant, now when fixed
spellings have been npecepted. Can -
‘some one explain Gn Nun nnd U'Rell,
both of which varlants fatigue me?—
