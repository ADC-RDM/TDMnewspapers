OPERNING A SUBMARINE. MACHINE IT yl

The Methd When. the 8hip ls About
9 Make an Attack.

Every ubmarine has its commander
—generall; a captain—who acts as the
very brain of the ship. No one else
can give cders, for so Interconnected
are all thi machines that the confict-
Ing commands from more than ono off:
cer would anost surely result in an
accident; hence &ery ono reports di.
rectly to the captin through the sec-
ond officer in cosmand, who, by the
way, is also respasible for the correct
operation of everthing from the bal-
last tanks to the orpedoes.

In making the attack the captain
mans the periscop in the main oper-
ating room, just béeath thé conning
tower. The lenses nd prisins in the
periscope tube trawmit the images
from the sighting pico above the wa-
ter down to the perficope eyepiece.

When the vesss' dives the decks aro
first cleared. Then the hatches are
senled down aad the ofl engines are
stopped in quik succession. Storage
batteries are tuned on to drive the
electric propellug motors. Electric
machinery mut be used under water
because the ofl engines consume pre-
clous air and exinust poisonous gases.

On the: next worl from the captain
water from outside 1a allowed to fl
tho hugo ballast tanks in tho central
lull. Other ballast tonks at the ends
of the boat are partially find) fo hd
the ship on an even keel. This trim-
ming of the submarine, of course, can
be delicately controlled by the buoyan-
cy gauges and controls in the operating
room,

The weight of all this water causes
the submarine to sink, but not com-
pletely. The horizontal rudders at the
stern of the ship are used to give the
final touches to the dive. The com-
mander directs the man at the wheel
how far down he wishes to go. By
watching the depth gauges in front of
him the wheelman can so tip the div-
ing rudders that the proper depth can
be found immediately and held exactly.

It takes but a minute or two to dive.
In torpedoing a ship the vessel must
be turned to alm the torpedo tubes,
which lig parallel with the central axis
of the “submarine—in the bow. The
command is given to fire. The gunners
in the forward compartment receive
the order through speaking tubes or
telephones. The torpedo {s discharged

Why People Get Fat.
“Among curious popular fallacies {is
the idea that an {individual may become
obese without eating too much and
way remain obese.even when very Mt-
tle food i8 taken. If a person each day
cats a butter ball weighing only a third
of an ounce In excess of the food
actually needed it seems trifling; insig-
nificant, but continued over a year it
would involve a gain in weight of nine

pounds of fatty tissue or in ten years |

of ninety pounds. An ounce of bread
or halt a glass of milk more than the
food requirement for the day will bring
about the same result. Conversely, if
the quantity of food taken be only

"slightly below tho needs of the body

some, of the body's own fat is used and
the body welght falls, a process which
may be extended over a long period of
time.—Dr. Graham Lusk in World's
Work.

How to Prevent Bees Swarming—

man In June—Methods by Which
to Destroy Troublesome Weeds.

HE statement that the milk.
ing machine has now be
come a practical proposl
tion can now be made with

considerable confidence. Practically
all the standard makes of machines
sold in this province, the cheaper
ones as well as the moro expensive,
are giving good satisfaction in the
hands of a great many dairymen.

ut all machines are some

what complicated, and somewhal
delicate of adjustment; so that to be
successful the operator must exercise

some mechanical ability, and strici
care and attention to the needs of in-
dividual cows, Without these the
milking machine bas always proved
a failure, It can bardly be eald that
the machine will get as much milk
from the cows as good hand milking,
but properly handled, It will give
better results than the average hand-
milking, and there is no doubt of Its
being a great economiser of labor and
time, The machine has its place on
the farms of dairymen who milk
more than ten cows, it being doubt-
ful economy to invest so much money
for o smaller herd. It may also be
doubtful economy to instal the ma-
chine In a herd of pure breds where
much official test work, involving
milking threesor more times per day,
is being done.—A, Letich, B.S.A.

To Prevent Bees Swarming,

June is the swarming month and
time of supering for the main honey
flow which begins between the 10tn
and the 20th of the month, depend-
ing on the season and the latitude.
Be sure. to give supers enough to
avoid any crowding which may cause
the bees to become discouraged, quit
work and swarm excesslvely. Jt
should be the beekeeper's alm (d
prevent swarming as much as pos-
sible. This is done by keeping young
queens, giving plenty of room and
systematic examination of brood-
chambers to detect colonies which
are preparing to swarm. When queen
cells are found far advanced they
should all be destroyed and the queen
herself removed. After the colony
bag been queenless one week the
combs should again be examined and
all cells except one removed. This
one will provide them with a queen
and ‘if only one is left they will not
swarm again, Whépe an improvement
of stock is desir the new queen
may be given instead of leaving one
queen cell, ¥

Natural swarms should be hived on
the old stand after .romoving the
parent colony . to ’'one side. The
swarms should be glven the supers
from the old colony. New swarms
work with great vigor because they
have no brood to care for during the
first week. Colonies held together
without swarming gather more honey
than those which swarm. It is the
beekeepers patriotic’ duty to reduce
the cost of honéy production and thus
increase the quantity he js called to
produce as greatly as possible. They
also cause the beekeeper less trouble
at unexpected times. This may be
done more by swarm prevention:than
in any other way. Bulletin 233 (On-
tario - Department of: Agriculture)
takes this matter up thoroughly and

should be carefully studied by all

beekeepers. — Provincial - Aplarist,
Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph.

Hints For the Gardener.

Thorough cultivation of the soil
must be practiged in the garden. The
common hoe, wheel hoe and the gar-
denccultivator should be kept golng
immediately after each rain. ’ The
seed sown in the field should be thin-
ned’ carefully, giving each plant the
amount of space required for good
growth. Use poison bran mash to

kill the cut worm, which will be ac

tive at this season. The asparagus
bed should bave the second applica-
tion: of 100 1bs. bor acre of nitrate
of soda. All stocks should be care-
fully cut even if they cannot be used.
Early celery, tomatoes and other
tender plants should phe get out the
first of this month, While citrons,
cucumbers, pumpkins and melons
should be planted. A Small amount
of nitrate of soda around celery and
tomato plants four or fiyy’ days after
setting out, will ald In {heir growtn.
The latter part of this ‘month and
the beginning of Dext, Inte celery,
cabbage, caulifiower and kale are
transplanted into the geld.” Sowing
of corn and beans ghould be ‘made
every week during this month,

DUST SPRAYS TESTED.

=

Potash-sulphur dusts dre not recom-
mended by the Ohio Experiment Sta-
tion for use in combination with ar 4
genicals in spraying trees and vege-
tables in foliage, although they have
proved efficient for dormant spraying
of fruit-trees. Lime-sulphur dusts are
considered worthy of cautious trials in
the usual arsenical combinations.

The sulphurarsenical compounds
for orchard dusting have given. re-
sults comparable with those obtained
from liquid sprays against cadling |

materials have been tested-at, the Ex-

Drilled corn has yielded mora than
that planted in hills when the same
amount: of sead was used per acre in
tests conducted by the Ohjo Experi-
ment Station. For hill planting three
kernels per-hill has been the most |=
satisfactory rate:

An increased yield of three bushels
per acre was harvested in favor of
drilled corn. Machine cutting’ is
eagler If corn Is drilled, but for har-
vesting by hand the hill method is pre-
ferred ‘by most farmers. Cultivation
is easier by the latter plan.

Four and flve kernels per hill haye
given slightly larger acre-ylelds than) =
a three-kernel rate, but the grain is
inferior in quality from such thick
planting on most sofls, With a
scarcity of seed corn, such as exists
this year, the planting’of three kernels
in hills 36 inches apart or the drilling
of kernels 12 inches apart is to be
recommended to Ohio farmers. . Spac-
ing plants 10 inches apart in the row
has ‘been found best for silage corn;
for, while the yield has been less than
