Announcing
. the ‘new
bigger
Comfort bar

Cumfort Soap is now a much bigger bar. It's the

sane soap absolutely, but we are giving you a larger

bax for the same money. We do this because we are withdrawing all
pfemiums as it is now impossible to get satisfactory premium goods
swing to the war.

No premiums but more soap

Dozens of premium-making factories are now making war supplies. Qthers
cannot ship, being across the ocean. * The new premiums offered us are
away under-Comfort Soap standards so when our present stock of premiums is
exhausted we will not issue any more—certainly not until after the war.

But we can still buy the splendid materials that
go into Comfort Soap, so we have decided to
make the Comfort bar much-bigger.

All Comfort wrappers now out in the stores will be
redeemed as heretofore but the wrapperon the new |
bigger Comfort bar will not be good for premiums. ¥

' Report of the Keeper of the House of Refuge. &

To the Warden and Council of the. County of Bssex, In Council assembled: —
Gentlemen,—Your Keeper-begs leave to report as.followa:— =

Our crops on the farm were very good, considering the bad years. There
was quite a bif“of the crop cut or pulled before it was ripe, as we had to go
tarough it with tilipg machine. We had four hundred bushels of potatoes—
hie potatoes wera struck with a blight and did not turn out very.good. We
riiséd ten hundred and seventy bushels of corn, four hundred and fifty bush-
els of carrots, eight hundred and seventy-five bushels of sugar beets, one
llundred and three bushels of.oniops, about twenty-five bushels of turnips, six
hundred heads of cabbage, three hundréd bushels of oats, and, three tons of
hay.

Wa tiled the farm every seventy feet, according to the Government. plans,
at hb cost of six hundred and ten dollars and sixty-five cénts for the tile,
forty-four dollars and ninety-seven cents freight on tile; cost of putting in
the tile was five hundred and eighty-four dollars and seventy-six cents,’ mak-
ing d total of twelve hundred and forty dollars and thirty-eight “cents, which
1 am sure will-4mprove the farm greatly. The outlet for the tile, Sturgeon
Creek, will have to be cleaned out in the spring or as Soon as possible or the
tile will not give good results. . - 3

We had to take down all cross fences on farm for tiling machine, and
have put same up in good shape, We’ put up one hundred rods of, new fence
on west Hine north'of the raflrond, and new fence around cemetery. :

We drew dirt and ‘filled up all the holes in the marsh and have same all
plowed but about three-quarters of an acre, 4

We constructed cement steps at front entrancd of house, this year, at a
‘cost of two' hundréd and twenty-five dollars, and ten dollars for getting out
apecifications, making a tofal of two hundred and thirty-five dollars. “The
house Is all finished inside and’ painter has first coat of paint on outside and
about half of the second. . He took sick and was unable to finish. We have
enough paint and material on hand to finish the outside work.

Wo have at present fifty-one inmates—forty-two males and nine females.
Twelve admitted, nine discharged; one absconded and eight deaths in the
Inst year. . # s . /

1 think it advisable to insert an extra run of tile between the seventy-
foot spans In the marsh’ land. As the marsh is not very long, the extra cost
would amount to”but little. A od o
: All of which is respectfully submitted. i
