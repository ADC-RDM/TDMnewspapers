We will dispense with going out and soliciting orders and have one delivery a day only

T 10 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNI

All orders telephoned or sent in}by the school children or otherwise up to 10 o'clock will be delivered by noon. : :

 

  

Owing to the constantly rising costs in the expense of doing business, we find it necessary to take this step and therzby do our bit
towards defeating the H. C. L., and we trust our many patrons will co-operate in this matter. With a little help on your part
by sending in your order early we will still be able to give you the same satisfactory service.

Phone or send in your order, or better still, pay us a visit.
