~ It is most important that the blood
"be kept cleared of impurities. This is
the business of the Kidneys. Onc hour's
incapacity on the part of the Kidneys
band the blood begins to get clogged
with poisons which are carried to all

more of the following symptoms: —

Rheumatism follows the crystalizing
of uric acid in the muscle tissues and
joints. Uric acid poisons should be
eliminated by the Kidneys.

Swollen joints and ankles indigate the
fmmediite need for Gin Pills. Pains in
the sides and back and through the
groins, constant headaches, restless
nights, derangements of the urinary sys-
tem, stone and gravel, puffiness under
the eyes and frequent chills—all these
shonld be taken as warnings and a
treatment with Gin Pills taken at once.

WEAK, NERVOUS

Such Sufferers Can Bc Restored By
Bullding Up the Blood.

ue

 

 

Nervous people who have mot yet
developed a disease that can be re-
cognized and trated by the medical
profession have the greatest trouble
in finding relief. Irritation, head:
aches, sleeplessness, Nervaus dyspep-
ska, all these discomforts make life
miserable, but are endured rather
than run a doctor's bill without de-
finite hope of an {improved condition.

Every sufferer should know the
danger of such a condition to the
nervous System. Nervous debility
and even peoralysis may result if the
tone of the nerves is not reatored.

The one big fact that brings hope
and relef is that the nerves can be
restored by building vup the blood.
It cannot be too often repeated that
only through the blood can nourish-
ment or medicine reach the nerves.

T NO TIME in many years has
the necessity and importance

cultivating some available land to
produce a portion of thelr own house-

and amatzur ' gardeners must have

patience antlll it is certain that good
