Simple Rules for Economical
Feeding. =

1. Grow as much of your own feed
as possible.

2. Utilize roughages to the great-
est degree possible.

3. Keep feeding stalls and pens

well lighted, dry, clean and well
ventilated.

4. Feed regularly.

5. Make changes in rations grad-
ually. ¢ "

6. Feed only, What {8 eaten up
clean and quickly at each feed.

7. Hayescléan fresh water before
the stock at all times,
“78. Study the individuality of each
animal,
9. .Feed. mixtures where possible,
‘as a variety of food {8 more palat-
able, and palatability is a factor in
digestibility.
10. Cit feed to avold waste.
11. Make a wide use of oats which
should form the basis of all our grain
rations.
12. Always be kind and quiet with

the stock. It pays. ;
13. Study market values of feed,
and compound balanced rations ac-
cordingly, in order that the cheapest
available be used,
14, Sco that the stock gets regular
and sufficient exorcise. f
15. Keep all feeding troughs, man-~
gers and utensils clean.—Prof. Wade

The Proper Ration for Horses When
the Fall Work Closes.

When the fall work is completed
and the hard-worked horse ds at the
beginning of hia long period of idle-
ness, feeders naturally plan to change
the “ration and ‘carry the horse
through the winter as cheaply as pos-
gible. The horse should get exercise
regularly. He should not be taken
from regular hard work and tied up
jn a stall doy in and day out, If pos-
#ible, the work should gradually eas
off and the feed, particularly the
grain’ ration, should “he cut down
accordingly. The idle horse may be
wintered ‘almost ‘wholly on rough-
ages. Good clover hay, or better, a
mixture of clover and timothy well
cured will serye as the main winter
feed. Roughages aro‘nlways cheaper
than grain, and where hay fs avail-
able the grain ration of the Idle
horse should be very small, but if
horses are fed straw in placoof hay
a small grain ration is required to
keep them from losing in flesh, A
fow roots are beneficial, a good-sized
turnip once a day or a few carrols
will be found to ald digestion. If
hay is not plentiful straw may be
substituted at the ‘noon feed and
roots given with it. In feeding hay
make the morning and noom-ration
smaller than the night feed, giving
about aa much at night as at the two
other feeds. Idle horses should bo
fed threo times daily. If any grain
whatever is fed make it rolled oats
and it Is not necessary to give more |
thin a'quarter the amount used when
the horses are at hard work provid-
ed plenty of good hay is available.

Once, he sald, he had put out a dead
horse for their bait, and watched rrom

A grizzly (called a sllvertip by the
hunters) approached, shouldered In be-

As ore fat grizzly can take up conslid-

third party at the feast and drew oft

and evidently clawed the Intruder or

knocked him 50 feat down the slope.
Then Mr. Slivertip resumed his repast

not even look around to see how far

FUEL SITUATION
WILL BE *SERIOUS

 

 

In a statement issued from the office.
of the Ontario Fuel Administrator, It
is pointed out that the anthracite fuel
situation In this province will doubt-
less be serious, and that It will be
necessary fo get along -on about 30
per cent. less anthracite coal than was
used last year. a

Among other circumstances that fur-
ther limjt. the allotment Is thé epi-
demic of Spanish Influenza, which has
reduced the anthracite coal produc-
tion by 1,500,000 tons in two weeks.
It {8 not likely that any portion of
this can be made up, and - the epi-
demic {8s pot stamped out in the min.
ing districts yet.

There is at present
stock of buckwheat. conl In*the hands
of the dealers, as well as high-grade
bituminous, which the publip Is adyis-
ad” to. secure to make upsany. defic-
fency in the supply of hard coal of
regular size.

“Speaking generally, there is no
longer any doubt that the anthracite
situation in the Province will"be seri-
ous, and unless the public co-operates
and; where possible, take steps to pro-
tect itself itself by the substitution of
wood, buckwheat and Bituminous coal...
conditions may become critical. There
is, however, no reason for panic, and
we will come through the winter sat-
isfactorily if we, one and all, save
coal and co-opbrate in the observance
‘of the fuel regulations. for the spirit
which won the war can, and will, solve
every peace problem,” says the satate-
ment.
