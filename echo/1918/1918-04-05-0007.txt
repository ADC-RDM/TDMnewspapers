machinery. .

A farmer with a Ford car can disnense with
one ar two of his horses and make the trips to
town, railway station, creamery, or to the neigh-
bours in one-third the time. In fact there is no
farm machine made that will save the busy
farmer and his busy wife so much valuable time
as a Ford. . And it’s so easy to take care of—far
easier than a horse. - No bed to make; or hay and
oats to get, no harnessing and unharnessing, and
no stables to clean. The Ford practically takes, .

Ask any farmer who owns a Ford if he would
