The meeting at tue Parish Hall Sat-

Anderdon and Malden was not very
largely attended owing to the threat-
ening weather, but those who have
the biggest interest in the work to-

so lacking in other similar assemblies.
The night was superb, the music par
excellence, and the lunch, ‘which was
served at one o'clock sharp, was ex:
quisite. The party broke up at 2.30,
every ope going home with the feeling
that a very pleasant time was spent.

The many friends of John Kerr will
be saddened to learn of his death
while in action in Flanders. Word
was received by his*oll friend and
companion, Henry Spaulding. While
on the island Mr. Kerr made a host of
good friends and was known as a man
of honest prineiples, a kind friend
and a prince of good fellows. His
parents have the heartfelt sympathy
of us all in their bereavement.

While the aatomobile accidents
during the past few weeks have been
reduced to a mere minimum, the
populace were electrified to hear of
this menace breaking out In a more
violent form than ever. While Law-
rence Gardiner was on his way to a
party at J. S. McCormick's, totally
oblivious of anything as accidents and
no doubt otherwise engaged, there was
a sudden roar, a crash, and presto
one of his rear wheels was loppd off
