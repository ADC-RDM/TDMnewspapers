Od Qentloman Thinks There Should
Be Something Definite Happen to
Treacherous Huhs.

“Pence!” sald my old man, “you

mike me tired.”

Somenxaited gent he was, and plank-
ed his unch pail down on th' bottom
step and then 'iimself beside It. °

“Did I fiver tiliye about the Garman
1 had th’ rough dase wid when I first
wint to wurrk in ‘h’ gan house?”

“Search me!” ses L. “You've had so
many rough houses it'd take a char
tered accountant to ‘keep thrack of
them.”

“Well! this rownd-hended Proosian
starts a Donnybreok—"

“Eh?” I asks. “He did?"

“Well, somebody did! Annyway we
got to locking horas. an’ wint to the
flure wid a jar that shuk th’ gas tank.
Like all Garmans he wes a dhirty fight-
er, 80 he was, an’ got me thumb In his
ugly mouth, an’ that nade me mad, an'
1 trompled*him*wid ne kee, un=well,

| he hollered pence, so he did. So 1 tuk
me leg out of 1s stommick, an’ Me

finger out of his eye, and got up on me
feet, and reached over an’ give him a
hand up, an’ he fetched me a belt wid
a plece of seantlin’ that lald me by the
heels for quite a spell, nn’ kept your
mother busy putting paultices on my
busted head.” ’

“What's that got ‘to do with the
war?" I asks.

“Well, th* Garmans 1s hollerin®
‘Peace’ ain't they, an’ Uncle Sam 18,
mnybe, good-natured enough to give
th’ bloody Huns a rest, und thin, he
gits sn@shed wid a scantlin® No, sir,”
he finikhed, as he gnthered up his lunch
pail and started into the back door,
“h' nxt Proosian I fit, it was who
wint to bed with poultices, so he did,
an’ I Wint to work th’ nixt morrnin'.
D'ye think I'm goln' widout me can o'
beer to buy thrift stamps, and thin

| have th® war end that way? - Not
{ much,.be jabers; we've got to lick ‘em
| first, an’ then they can holler all the

‘pence’ they want."—Edward 8. Plls-
worth of The Vigilantes, d

German “Kultur.”

0. Journelle, a French writer, dis-
courses In the Atlantic Monthly of
“Prussian Manners,” and though he
never grows emotional or Is otherwise
than cnlm and moderate In expression

I he sets forth a most damning picture.
! After

showing how unconquered
French seiner are after months
of prison brutality he gives it as his

“bellef that the German tyranny does

not consist simpl¥ in an exorbitant ap-
plication of the dogma of might. “It
has special mortifications, peculiar to
the race, which make it even more
painful If that 1s possible. 1 1s not fo-
spired solely by the systematic des-
potism dnd = Immorality cynlenlly
adopted by Germany; it is not a pure,
unadulterated application of ‘any docs
trine: it springs from a genuine lack
of morality, and from a well-spring of -
vicious animalism, which psychologists
have 80 often detected in the German
blood. y

“Not,” hie adds, “that I am so foolish
as to hold ‘that all Germans are 10W,
mallghant, and brutal; but it can be
gald without hesitation that such ls,
generally speaking, thelr psychical
type, more or less emphasized; that

1 such are thelr racial tharacteristics, as

appears from {nntmerable facts gath-
ered from the lips of our repatrintes
ofl every locality.”

‘Age No Drawback to Service.

| “There {8 no, such thing. as a ‘re-

tired patriot.” One is never too old
to render some service to one's coun-
try.” .

This g sentiment of Mrs. Richard

Flower, nlnety-four years old, has fm-

pelled her to become one of the lead
Ing Red Cross workers of New Orleans.
Since the declaration of war she has
knitted a, dozen sweaters, eight. pairs
of socks and many helmets, mufflers
and washcloths. The Red Cross au-
thorities highly praise Mrs. Floweér's

industry and say that her example has
been invaluable.

e not only works
every day at the production of Red
Cross articles, but alko keeps abreast

| of the war news in the papers. She

was assisted in several entertninments
tor the benefit of the Red Cross.

Mrs. Flower has reared a family of
five sons and three daughters. One of
her sous was the late Mayor Flower
of New Orleans.

Men of Middle Age Indulge In
Gomparisons :

Lack of Thrift In Rising Generation
Especially Subject of Comment—
Finally Thoroughly Convinced
“The World Do Move.”

Two plainly dressed, spbstantial
looking men of fifty or thereabouts
were: discussing the high cost of llv-
ing, dying and every other old thing
while having thelr shoes polished In
a place just off Herald square. One
was saying he couldn't figure how per-
gons of , small ~ earning capacity
were maonpglug to keep body and
soul together. The other ventured the
opinion that the. class of persons he
referred to were not entitled to the
sympathy they were getting because
their standard of living was out®ot
all proportion to thelr pay envelopes.

“When we were youngsters back in
| the middle West,” the second man
went on, “we considered ourselves
lucky If we got some plain schooling
and three fairly square meals a day.
We had pennies where ‘the average
| boy in this town has dimes nnd guar
| ters. _After we came. to New York
we waited until*we were fairly well
established before we Induiged In
even amall luxuries. It scems to me
that small wage earners have lost all
sense of thrift.”

«Even a8 he spol theas came an fl-
lustration of his remarks In the per:

gon of. a messenger boy, who climbed |
‘| into the next sent and directed the

bootblack to polish his russct shoes
and put In new Inces. After giving
thig order the boy bit a five-cent bar
of thocolafe In half, took a clgurette
from a ten-cent package, and then set-
tled down to rend a magozine that had
cost 15 cents. The two men exchanged
amused glunces.

“That boy's shine and refreshments
and ‘other things will: eost him fifty-
five cents,” gald the man who had been
doing most of the talking. “Honest,
I don’t think I spent that much in a
month when I was his age.”

“Nor 1,” laughed the other, “And
ft was a great lark when we were
boys to shine our own shoes. When
we felt real wicked we smoked clona-
mon clgaréttes. A couple of cents
would hoy ¢nough material to provide
smokes fora whole crowd.”

“And a five-cent thriller was passed
from one boy to another until all the
youngsters in town had read It,” add-
ed his friend.

They stole another look at the
young plutocrat, sighed deeply and
left the place shaking thelr heads.
Crossing the street In this contem-
plitive mood, they barely escaped be
{ng knocked down by & youth on a mo-
torcycle. .

“And we used fo feel renl reckless
on our velocipedes.” mused one.

Spying on Sples.

Spy sples on §py in Germany. The
Germin office holder, ex-Amhassador
Gerard writes in the London Times,
tears the sples of his rivals. “T often
said to Germans holding high office
duting. the war: “This strain 18 break-
ing you down — nll day In your af-
fice. Tanke an afternoon off and come
shooting with me. Thejinvariable an-
swer was, 'T cannot; the others would
learn .it from thelr sples and would
sprend the report that I neglect busl-
ness*” German sples are adepts at
opening bags, steaming letters—all the
old. tricks. The easlest way to bafie
them, Mr. Gerarg says, is to write
pothing that cannot be published to
the world. “For a long time after. the
beginning of the war 1 was too, busy
to write the weekly report of officinl

gossip teually sent home by diplomat- |

{ste. 1 suppose the Germans searched
