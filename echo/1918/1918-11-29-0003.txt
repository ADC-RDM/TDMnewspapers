FALL WHEAT SEASON
THE. BEST IN YEARS

Even the Very Late Sown Fields are
Making Good Promise.

CROP FOR ONTARIO

pele

THE

Average Yield of Fall Wheat Exceeds
That of Spring Sown.

The splendid results obtained from
sowing Spring wheat in Ontario this
year served wonderfully in the crisis
which arose from the very generpl
faflure' of Fall whent in the province,
and it js only reasonable to expect
that the very good yields obtained
from that crop’ will hive the result
of still further increasing the acre-
age sown, next spring, In fact, many
farmers have withheld from sowing
their usual acreage of wheat this fall,
largely on account of the superior ro-
sults from the Spring variety during
the past season. Futhermore, the
growing of a Fall wheat has proved
a disappointing business for two years
in succession, owing to unfavorable
weather conditions at sowing time or
elsey to the loss. caused By excessive
winter killing. To further discourage
the habitual Fall wheat grower. this

year's seeding-time was anything but

ideal for the getting in.of a falr-afzed
ngoreage, and most of the sowing was
dona. either a Tittle on the early side
or much too late to suitithe {dens of
the most experienced. Now, however,
well on In. November, when as a rule}
the growth of Fall'wheat 1s beginning
to-slow up on account of cold weath-
er, the crop Is going ahead by leaps
and bounds, and growers who-feared
that they lind“sown very much on tho
late alde are beginning to take heart
for. the chances of their crop and to
rogret that they were unable to take
the grain drill over an wider area.
Others who passed up wnntever chance
they had to sow Fall wheat in o
to reserve the acréage for Spring
grain, are beginning to regret thelr
omission. ’ 2

On the strength of psy records of
yleld of (Fall wheat and Spring whent
In the province, It seems hardly advis-
able to desert the former entirely in
favor of the latter merely because of
the unusual performance of Spring]
wheat In one season. For a period of]
33 years the average yield per acro of
