You'll Be Sure of Having An All-
Wool Coat This Winter

We would not mislead youn into believing there will be an overcoat
shortage—get this distinction.

There will be woollen overcoats available but prices will be such
that, in many cases, they will be out of the reach of the ordiniry man.

 
             
 

Why not make sure of having a warm, first quality woollen overcoat
this winter by purchasing one now, a little in advance of the regular

season.
Compare the quality of our fabrics—styles are much alike because

of Government restrictions—also compare our prices for the same qual-
ity merchandise,

Then -you will understand why we say “Buy Your Overcoat Now.”
