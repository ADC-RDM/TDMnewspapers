pounced upon a pretty girl whose ap-
pearante denoted aminbility and ap-
plied for her. It happened that she
was not engaged. I was introduced to
her, and our drill was commenced. T
was handed a printed slip which read
as follows:

“My dear, when I married you Y sup.
posed I<was marrying you alone. I

I was instructéd by Mr, Lareamorey

to speak these words angrily to my
dummy wife. I did so, and despite the
fact that X was playing a part I saw
the hot blood mount to her cheek. She
made no reply, for the instiucios inter-
posed.

“Those words should not iva been
uttered,” he gald, “though. they may

“We have an room In which we put

“for the s¢ ost test that can be ap-
plied. “It furnished throughout in

“What did you do with this couple?”
1 asked.

“Chey are now

“Ninety per cent.”

“Is jt the-mother-in-lnw virus alone
that produces the trouble or are there

“Quito often there are other ingre-
dients, but it Is safe to say that~with
the mother-in-law removed 70 per cent
of such cases would pull through.”

“What is the best anti-toxin,” I ask-

ed, “for a wife on the verge of trans-
forring her affections to nrother man?’

“Another woman."

“And 1 suppose my bypotbetical
wifé's part in the anti-toxin for a hus-
band infatuated with another woman

“Only as a last resort.” replied the
professor. “The interference of the

those in which a quarrel bad got under

very angry for the purpose ‘of being
