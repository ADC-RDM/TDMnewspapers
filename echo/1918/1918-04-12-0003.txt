“o KEEPING YOUNG .

Datmeal is Sald] to Ward Off Age—
Often 20 Years

Two noted scientists, by experiments on
animals, bave proved that youthfulness de-
pends on the thyroid gland. And that some-
thing in oats seems to feed that gland.

It appears that old can be deferred
many years by caring for this gland. The
main care is to feed it, and the proper food
is oats.

Oats contain more. ene food, more
food for the brain, more food for the nerves,
than ay other grain that grows, Aad now it
seems that theyalso serve to keep one young.

But common oatmeal isn't good enough
for such an important diet. The rich,
plump grains alone are used in the ma!
of Quaker Oats. They are.sclected’d
siftings, and only ten pounds are obtained
from a bushel g .
