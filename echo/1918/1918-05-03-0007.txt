Ross, of Brucefield, or the Rev. Lachlan
MacPherson, of East Williams. So
my surprise was complete when a brisk
man in khaki uniform stepped into the
room. He did not look enough like
those old ministers to make my heart

come into my mouth with terror as I

faced him. Neither did he look enough
fike a military martintt to make me

_dlick my heels together and come to

agttention.” And there was absolutely
nothing to suggest the producer of *“ best

discover that “Ralph Connor” is, first

High Conmand had something of the
at Heuie you suggest. ra whenever
Was an, to be done to hel
the boys the MCA, was there to >
it and do it well. By its spirit of un-
assuming belpfulness the V.M.C.A. has
wow itl hearts of both the officers and
men, no matter what their church con
nections may be or not be. . It
gives and it does not anything in
return Tid sole reward is that it helps
freely all who need help. The thing to
emphasize about its work is that it
gives—it is an organized spirit of giving,
nd kt, gives without a string to the
ving."

JA reference to the old ministers gave |

us an instant point of contact, and with
much laughter—kindly and reverent—
put still laughter—we compared notes
and exchanged reminiscences of the good
men who made the Scotch settlements
where we had both been brought up, the
places of stern discipline we remembered
so well. - The hour that had been prom-
{sed to me was gone and part of another
pour with it, before I remembered that
the man who the meeting had
pot done it out of pure kindness. He
wanted me to interview Ralph Connor
about the war work of the Y.M.C.A.
By the time I remembered my duty we
kad reached a point where I felt that I
could ask him about it from a rather
daring point of view. I began with a
straight question:

“What do you-think of the work of
the Y.M.C.A. in the war?”

He hunched'his shoulders slightly and
slipped down a trifle in his chair. From
the expression on his face I was afraid
that he was going to offer an unfavor-
able criticism. But his answer made it
clear that that was not what disturbed
him:

“Tt is doing n lot of work that the
churehvshould be doing.”

Now you can understand why my
question caused him a shade of discom-
fort. ‘Fhe minister in him—a touch of
the old Free Kirk spiritual guide that
made him feel the responsibilities of his
calling—made him regret to confess that
a purely lay institution is carrying prac-
tical Christinnity to a point that is as

t impossible for the churches—*beat-
ing them to it,” as the soldier boys
would-say. @ hi

“Don't misunderstand me,” he
tested. “The churches and their chap-
lains are doing a wonderful work, but
the Y.M.C.A., being without a propa-
ganda or dogmas, is able to adapt itself
iptantly. tay needs that may arise,
el battlefront or v
the boys may be located. It

them at all hourt and inal places with

‘a spirit of good cheer, comfort and help-
fulness.” od ok L

# Then you are of the opinion that the
man who supports the war watk of his
church'is not doing all he can to help

the boys?"

Assuredly. The Y.M.C.A. is able
togo alittle farther, « Though the work
«of the church may be nearer to the ideal
of what I want toseedone, the Y.M.C.A.
gets nearer to the boys.”

That struck me as a very important

" point, and I decided to question him

\

from an angle that might not be pleasing
to a clergyman.
“You know,” insinuated, in a spirit

ol balf confession, “that there ore a lot

of boys who would be inclined to look
at,g V.M.C.A. at home as a sort of
\sis#fled institution, beneath the notice
of young men of the world who like to
affect.qy sort of manly, wildness. Does

the Y.M.C.A¢ get near to them?”

“Yes. The helpfulness of the Y.M.-
C.A. has won out; over every obstacle.
In the beginning, the officers of the

RALPH CONNOR.

, But. I often hear comments, not
always friendly—about the prices that
the: Y.M.C.A. charges for some of its
supplies’

“ Such comments have no justification.
The prices are as near right as they can
be made. If there is any profit on the
sales to the boys in the camps or back
of the lines, every cent of it goes to pro-
vide things free—absolutely free—to
those who are in the'front line trenches.
As 0 matter of fact, the canteens and
other orgmnizations under the control of
the churches and chaplains have pretty

much thie same schedule of prices as the
YMCA" ’

0)

I coulid not suppress a smile at find-
ing my ancient enemy the trust or
“Gentleman's cement” appearing in
80 admirable a form. But I made no
comment. - Instead, I asked a conclud-
ing question:

“Then I may, itell the people that in
its war. work, especially in the matter of
creature comforts, the Y.M.C.A. is
nearer to the boyrs anyone else?”

When leaving hilm, I stopped to talk
to several other clgirgymen who appeared
in the offing—it wras a place of clergy-
men—and he sfaipped, from’ the room.
Shortly afterwiirds he returned with a
copy. of his latest book, on the fly-leaf
of which he hind written in memory, of
the men we hid known in our boyhood:

“There weire giants in those days.”

It will be- cherished as one of the most
prized of alitstle collection of autographed

of hours with a well-known man who is ;
doing a noble woirk himself and isnot
afraid to give the fiillest credit to other
men who are doing @ foble work—such
as the officers and fielid-workers of the
Y.M.C.A., “who play sich a great for
