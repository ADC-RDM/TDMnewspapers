Road improvement vvas-miterially
affected by war.conditions during the
years of 1917-18, more especially: by
scarcity of labor, high wages, and laclk
of railway services for transporting
materials. Acting on the general prig.
ciple that all kinds of unnecessary ex.
pendi‘ure should undoubtedly be avold.-
ed in time of war, both national an&
municipal, the department did not en- |
courage road  construcilo except |
wher dictated by means of ef-
ficloncy and economy, - Since the war |
is over, the improvement of roads is
a question that has arain come to the
front. It {s recognized that the waste
of time in transporting goods or driv.
ing over bad roads is great; that much
fneficlency is created by bad rads,
and that becsuse of bad ropds, farm
produce is frequently lost or greatly
depreciated by the inability to place
it on the market. Road meintoncnce
means largely that a limited ariouat of
time and effort are expended on the
repairs and Improvements of the
roads In order that a great and com-

| paratively large amount of time and

enérgy may- be saved in travel and
transportation over them; In order
that still other trafic ‘7uheh would
have to take less economical routes
will follow the improved road; And in
order that still other trafic which
would not exist may be created and
developed. Every ono with the inter
est of his municipality at heart should
energetically devote his efforts to or-
ganization for road improvement not
only for the comfort and convenience
it would bring to them individually but
also that this {important work may be
utilized as far as possible in adjust-
ing our “afterthe-wor" problems. Ev.
ery oportunity:to secnre improved road
system should be seized upon. The
Highway Department is encouraging
all townships to place their road ex-
pendfturo in charge of & permanent
rond superintendent or foreman and to |
this end will pay (Under the Ontario,

Mr. Editor,—~Complainlg at present
about the impassible condition of the,
ronds In this part of the county, and
@specinlly that part from Harrow to
Kingsville, which a &itizen of the.for-
mer village says Is the worst stretch
of road from here to Toronto, is gen-
ral, and travelling over them either
by motor or buggy'ls well nigh Impos-
slible, especially In the vicinity of Ar-
ner, east of the townkine, where it is a
usigal sight each day at present to see
on or more autoes atalled and under
the necessity of deing drawn out by
hojrges. That this condition of roads
shiould be tolerated by taxpayers and
the general travelling public 18 a
conundrum to me, seeing that this part
of the township is so heavily assessed
to maintain a, proper highway, and
yot year after year nothing is done by
the council for the upkeep of the road
in this locality excepting for a few
londs of gravel dropped here and there,
but none for the first mile enot of the
townllne, but that part of the road
was overdone this past year by the
building’ of an extravagant cement
culvert. Autolsts find the 2nd conces-
sion, in fact two.or three of the con.
cessions north of the section road a
much better highway to travel over,
and, the reason {s not far to seck, see-
{ng these roads get the attention of the
council as well as the gravel, not to
mention the Diyision Road, which by
way of comparison is like a boule
vard, and at the expense of the rate-
payers from the west part of the |.
township in a large proportion. One
does not require very rauch discern-
ment to see the unfairness of our
municipal council In treating the rate.
payers of this community in such a
manner- A radical change in the
council board might be a means of
improving the condition of the affairs
of this western part of Gosfield South
