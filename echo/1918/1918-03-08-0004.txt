SOME HEN, THIS!

 

 

 

Chatham has a hen which is setting
a record in egg laying. Since the first
of the year she has laid two eggs a
day for the majority of the days, and
has never missed laying at least one
egg. Her record fs threc- eggs in six
hours. An expert poultry man was in
Chatham trying to purchase the hen.
and when he could not, he paid $30 for
six eggs. An effort is) being made to
find a good mate for this hen, as she
has beaten records. of the best layers
at the Ontario Agricultural College. J.
W. Ingram is the owner of this black
Minorca.

FORMALIN TREATMENT
PREVENTS OAT SMUT

 

 

 

Formaldehyde is the ‘common ma-
terial used to treat oats.for prevention
of smelt A pint of 40-per cent. formal-
dehyde. known commercially as for.
malin, to 40 zallons of water will treat
40 to 45 bushels of grain.

A sprinkling can is convenient to
moisten the oals spread ont on a light
floor or canvas. By shovelling ver the
grain the entire mass can be thorough-
ly moistened with the solution. The
heap is then covered with a blanket
for. about three or four hours or over
night and later spread to.dry.

The Ohio Experiment Station rec-

ommends the Hberal use of formalin |

to prevent oat smut, as the treatment
has caused material’ increases in crop
yields. It cautions farmers to use the
same solution freely to disinfect bags
and ‘drills used in seeding the oats.
