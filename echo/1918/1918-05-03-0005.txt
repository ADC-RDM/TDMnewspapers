How Children of the Ignorant
Are Robbed of Oatmeal

A canvass made among the intelligent
shows that seven homes in eight serve
catmenl. Among the ignorant another can.
vurcs shows, that not one home in twelve
rerves oats. {The children grow up incapa-
ble because bodies nnd brains are starved.

Nature storesin oats more energy food,
more brain food, more nerve food than in
any other grain that grows. That's why
children crave oatmety,’ There 1s nothing;
to take its plnce,

This is a food on which it doesn't pay to
be careless. There is a wery wide differ-
ence in ont foods—a difference in richness
und (ood value. Don't serve the common

Only the richest, plumpest grains are
used in Quakep' Oats, They are selected

in all the oat elements—the utmost in ant

“Wanied—A stenographer who Is
dumb. bit-not deaf; must’ be over thir
ty Ne others need apply: :Oall Mon-
day mirning at Congressman ‘Pragg's
office 4¢ the Davenporte,”

Perhaps the single afiction of belng
dumb without being deaf is not a rare
ane, but In Washington on the Sunday
that this advertisement appeared In
the lo¢al papers, women so handl-
capped were not numerous. Or, if
they were, they were not stenogra-
phers in serch of a job. Of the half-
dozen dump applicants, there was one
whose hearing was keen enough and
whose stedOEraphy was good enough
to justify the. congressman's young-
man , gecretary—who sized , them up
when they came to the officB—Iin refer-
ring her to the congressmhn lilmself.
That was Mardy Mapes, and she was
not entirely what the congressman had
usked for In the advertisement. She
admitted to the secretary fn writing,
on the small tablet of paper that she
carried around with her, that she was
under thirty, and anyone could have
told at a glance that she wasn't even
twenty-five. “However,” she wrote to
the copgressman when he objected to
her on the score of extreme youthful-
ness: “I am old In my ways and I
cun Joolk much older If I dress in plalp
dark clothes.” 4

The congressman frowned a little
at her to show his disapproval, but
consoled] himself with the thought
that If he kept her in his employ long
enongh, she would eventually reach a
sultablie _age. ~ On general principles,
It seemed, Congressman Pragg lad an
abjection to young women, Some peo-
ple whispered that this was because of
same early disappointment In Tove, but
those who knew him better knew that
im the congressman's uphill climb from
8 poor farmer's boy to the leading
man of his state, there had been no
time for flirtation or love-making.

“You may consider’ yourself em-
Plloyed,": sald. the congressman, and
thie smile that came over Mardy's face
fhiowed that she heard perfectly In
Spite of her total dumbness. “Now, I

could detect In theimost minute varia-

this constant studying of her face
came to be ns mugh a pleasure to him
as anything else that made up his
busy days. :

Then, as spring camo on, the cop-
gressman became more than ordinarily
pensive, * Even at the capitol it was
commented on that Pragg had some
cause to worry, anf Mardy's most |o-
quiring and symputhetic look of ¢n-
treaty, did not draw his secret from
"bis lips. 4 =
t~ One day when Mardy arrived In the

‘morning, she feund the congressman |

already at his desk‘—something entire-
ly unprecedented—4ind" Mardy ‘seemed
to know when she Arst-caught his
glance, that dt last the'time’ Had come
for her to know hif secret care,

“I have something to tell you,” he
begun, abruptly, ndt looking at her—
though he usually studied her face
with such keen Interest. “I have se-
curcd the gervices of one of the great-
est of throat specidlists—Doctor Spig-
genheim—perhaps You have heard of
him. He 18 comin fl down to Washing-
ton as a special concession. He'll be
here this morning, ¢I want him to ex-
amine your voenl cords, and see If
Something cannot he done for them.
He says It 18 a marvelous cise—that
your dumbness hasn't affected your
hearing or any of your other senses,”

Had the congrestman been watch-
Ing Mardy’s face then he might have
Seen that she started and then turned
perceptibly paler. ‘She made no writs
ten “reply “or acknowledgment of her
gratitude to her would-be benefactor,
and they were both uncommunlicative
for the rest of the morning,

At Mardy's writton request she saw
the great specialls nlone, and then
ie specialist saw. {he congrefsman
alone, and then the: congressman, hay-
Ing bonded the specialist his thousand-
dollar fee, caw Mardy nlone,

The congressman . looked pensive
and grave. Very tenderly and, trying
to conceal his own disappointment, he
told Mardy of the specialist's verdict
—that, _ strangely enough, Mardy's
speeelilessness was incurable, This
time the congressmun studied Mardy's
face, but it showed nothing save a
studied immobility.

They both tried -to £0 back to the
work of the day, but unsuccessfully,
and then the congressman broke the
silence. “I'll have to tell You what fs
worrying me—and torturing me,” he
sald. “I'l tell you, and then you can
declde what we ought to do. Mardy,
I want to marry You. I hued never

There wna a short pause, and then,

cach word as If hearing a woman talk
had "always been the Joy of his life.
“I came to Washington, hoping to get

Necessary Farm
Equipment:

ORE and more the Ford ear is looked

upon by progressive farmers as neces-

_sary fagm equipment, the same as the

low, the hay-rake, the drill, the mower, -the

narrow and other labor and time-saving
machinery. &

A farmer with a Ford car can dispense with
one or two of his horses and make the trips to-
town, railway station, creamery, or tothe neigh=
bours in one-third the time. In fact there's no
farm machine made- that will save the busy
farmer and his busy wife so much valuable time
asa Ford. And it’s so easy to tak:
easier than a horse. )
oats to get, no harnessing and unharnessing, and

no stables to clean, The Ford practically takes,

ever again try to get along without it. His
answer will hasten your decision to'own one,
