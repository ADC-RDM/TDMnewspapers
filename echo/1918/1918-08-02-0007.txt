Upper Cn into. nineteen dounties and the Provincial Legislature at it
frat session at Nowark, on the 16th October, 1792, (32 Geo. IIL. c. 8) re-namei
‘ A abovo four last named districts in their order, the Eastern, Midland, Homs
4 Western. )
ES 4h tho same last mentioned proclamation Essex was made the eighteenth!
] county and was to be bounded on the east by the county of Suffolk, on the
. J Guth by Lake Erie, in the west by Detroit River to Malsonvllle’s" Mill, from
thence by & line running parallel to the River Detroit and Lake St, Clair at
«he distance of four miles until it meats the River Tranche, or Thames, thence
w the said river to the northwest boundary of the County of Suffolk.

By the 38th, Geo. 111. ¢, 6: An Act for the better division of the Province
promulgated by proclamation let January, 1800, it sald: “The Townships of
Tochestor, Mersea,, Gosfield, Maidstone, Sandwich, Malden, and the tracts of
land occupied by the Huron and other Indians upon the Strait, together with
such [slands as are in Lakes Erie, St. Clair and the Straits, do constitute and
form the County of Essex. Sec, 40 provided that Essex and Kent, together
with so much of this Province as {3 not Included within any other district
thereof, do constitute the Western District.” =
Sec. 7 of this Act of October, 1792, authorized the Justices of the Peace In
Quarter Sessions assembled to procure plans and specifications and elsvations
of a gaol and’ court house, and to contract for same to be completed within
clghteen months, and that the gaol and court house for the Western District
shail bo built in the manner afpresald as near to the present court house as
conveniently may be. This of ourse was In Detroit.

By 38, Geo. II, c. 6, 1793, it was provided that the Court of Quarter
Sessions of the Peacd for tha Western District should commence and be
golden in the Town of Detroit, and that Special Sessions of the Pence should
commence to be holden, yearly and in every year In the Town of Machil-

ackinac. :

» This. ordeg of things/obtained till tho Act of June 3rd, 1796, which provided
{or the departure of British adthority from Detroit to Sandwich, and the hold-
{ng of General Quarter Sessionsein the parish of Assumption on the second
Tuesday of the months of July, October, January and April “until such time
as it shall seem oxpedient to the Justices to hold the same nearer to the {sland
called Isle of Bois Blanc.” A similar provision was made as to the County
Court. The last Court of Quarter Sessions held in Detroit was In January,
1796, as tho removal tool place to Sandwich that summer. And as there
pover was a removal to Bols Blane or Amherstburg, the court house was
erected In Sandwich on tho ground where the present court house stands.

“What Is to be done with that pre-
clous pair of fools up there Is what I
can't figure out,” sald Jim Barker,
blowing a cloud of smoke from his
stubby pipe. :

“We just can't do anything,” replied
Joe Timmins, sending a blue cloud over
to meet and mingle with that of Jim.
“We've tried to tell them that they're
foolish, but you can't git anything into
that woman's head, except that we are
oll a set of d——scoundrels, nnd try-
Ing to chisel them out of a rich mine,
I aza plumb outdone with them, and yot
we can't let them go on thisaway. To-
morrow will be New Year's, and there
they are up there working like he-
roes at something that will never pay.
I wish to goodness some of them smart
Alecks In the big colleges would find
some way of dealing with refractory
ore. Who in Halifax sent ‘em up there,
anyhow?”

“Oh, some one in Havilah. You see,
the chap, he's a lunger. Got sick In
some of them high skyscrapers in Now
York, and they sent him and that slip
of a gal out here to rough It in the
mines, hoping that he'd get well—"

“Well, he's In pretty fair health just
now, as you'd know If you seen him
at work. But, they've sunk every dol-
lar they had In that d— old Key-
stone, She thought the stones were
so pretty! And. so they are, nll green
as emeralds, and full of gold, that you
could cut out with a pocliet knife,
but which will never pan out a ‘dollar
to the hundred tons.”

“T told him and her, when they took
out the claim papers that It was bad
ore, but thoy knew so much better
than I did that I finnlly let them go
ahead. Well, they have thelr twenty-
stamp mill up and the first clean-up
will be made. to-morrow. They are a
palr of fools, but they are such en-
guging fools—what will they do when
they find out?’ sald the man who
kept the saloon.

At this moment a man who worked
for Ed. Ingram, the “fool,” cume down
the trail from the Keystone mine.

“Say, 18 they a doctor in this here
place? If they Is, he [8 wanted up to
the Keystone mighty quick. And,
where's Annette? She's wanted, too.”

“Who's hurt? What's the matter,
anyway?" asked Jim.

“Matter? Matter enough, I should
say. Here is this gal away from home

they shone. The big hopper was ready
filled with ore. The blankets had been

made ready. The little stream, of wa-
ter that was to mix with the pulverized
rock was waiting to begin its work.
The turbines below were fllled with
water, and the quicksilver there, © All
was" waiting for the signal, but the
Ingrams,_had spent thelr last dollar,
Then, great machine began to’
move, the stemps to rise and fall with
chythmic re ty, the broken rock
to fill the trough and the water to
flow. The Keystone mill was fn full
operation. \ :

Winter had been abnormally open
and so far not a flake of smow had
fallen In the mountains. Only a few
light rains, and 50 It was that after
nine weeks of blind labor the first real
knowledge of the value of the mine
would be known. The young people
up at the mine were happy, and felt
that thelr prospects were bright. The
Joy of achlevement was greater than
anything else. They would know to-
morrow. The New Year should see the
culmination of their toll and sacrifice,
and Its recompense.

But In her ignorance Mary had not
foreseen how much she was to “need
her mother” untll New Year's eve.

Finally one, of the men at the saloon
remarked: “The whole business won't
pan out an ounce. They were in a
devil of a fix before, and now—well
I'm sorry for them.” ;

“So am IL” sald Doc Stimson, “and
I'm sorry just thirty ounces.”

One of the othor men remarked to
the celllng that he was sorry fifty
ounces. Finally ail present “chipped
in” and there was a gathering of near-
ly two hundred ounces of gold, some of
it In bottons, from the retorts, some
river dust, and some the dull grains
from placers, ’

Almost without a sound the crowd
started for thé Keystone with the gold
they had contributéd. The watchman
wns so glad that he was not to be |
lynched for not having told the fool-~
{sh children the truth that he was per-
fectly willing to enter the plot, which
wns to place all this gold Into the
turbine tub and allow Ingram to be:
lieve it gold from his mine. The main’
point now was to keep the fatal truth
from them. Later—well they would
gee. ' So, they all sat down to’ walt
for daylight and possibly news from
the shack. They put a stone in the
gear of the turbine so that the motion

TRACTOR ON-A RUBBER FARM |

Machine on 20,000-Acre Sumatra
Plantation Does Work That Re-
3 quired Hundreds of Coolles.

The value of the tractor in expedit-
Ing farm work ‘has been recognized
In many ways, but a striking example
of Its utility as applied to the culti-
vation of rubber has been shown by
the employment of a tractor on a rub-
ber plantation of 20000 acres in Su-
matgn, controlled by one of the largest
tire manufacturers in this country. In
former days, says a writer, it required
250 coolles’ to plow three acres'a day,
but by utilizing a tractor 20 acres are
now plowed In that time,

At the time the tractor was pur-
chased nbout 2,000 acres were produc-
Ing rubber, and consignments from the
plantation are now coming to. the
American factory. Ee
. The development of the plantation

was due to the recognition by the com- “|=

pany that it was necessary to protect
{ts rubber supply back to the tree. It
was ono .of the Jossons brought forel-
bly to the attentionrof the commercial
world'due to the war that without cons’

trol of raw material supply back of

the source, In case of a disturtinnce in |

 

|market and transportation conditions,
business would be greatly handicapped.
