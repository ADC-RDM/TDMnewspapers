WOMEN'S AND MISSES’

In these October days we present a spe-
cial purchase of all wool navy blue Serge
dresses, with one idea in mind—to give won-
derful dresses at a popular price—wholly dis
regarding the steady advance in this p:actica]
and serviceable fabric. Up-to-date models,
beautifully designed, braided, embroidered
and fringe trimmed. Two styles are pictured.
