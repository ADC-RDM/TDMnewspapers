THE LOVE OF OATS CARATAY

hy 1, Active People Always
Why LE Oatmeal /

Oats contain more body-puilding food than
gay other grain that grows, They contain
wore energy-giving food. ‘You know their
effect on horses. 0"

Oats contain gnore organic phosphors
than any Other grain, and phosphorus is the
brain's main constituent, They contain
more lecithin, and lecitbin is the chict
component of the entire nervous system,

That's why workers love oatmeal. That's
why growing children craveit. Itis simply
the call of nature for what bodies, brains
azd nerves require,

But some oatmell fpils to meet theso
requirements, Only tHe richest, pinmpest
y a food worth while. The chofg-
are sifted 62 times to get the
gra yr Quaker Oats. Only ten pounds
gre secured from a bushel. Hut these fino
ts, when prepared by the Quaker proc-
pply the utmost.in oatmeal,

Oatmeal is the most important food you
serve, And the best costs only one-half
cent per dish, Don't supply your table
with inferior oats. LL

the Belgian Invasion Began.

“Had it not been for the French alr
service,” says Burtod J. Hendrick in
thp World's Work, “France would have
been destroyed in the first few weeks
of the great world war, >

“For years the French general sta
‘md expected an attack through Bel
glum. The strategic railroads which the
Gernanp, were so painstakingly build.
ing up to the Belgian frontier could
| convey no other meaning. Yet the
“Frenchmen ¢ill believed ¢hat the main
onslaught would come across the
French , frontier and bad made their
plans for their greatest resistance in
this region. France entered the war’
with only about 100 army airplanes,
but Germany, which had foreseen the
part this new instrument Was to play,
bad a much larger equipment.

“Yet a few days after the Belginn
invasion began French aviators flying
pear the Belglan-German frontier saw
a sight that immediately caused a
change in the French operations. The
Germans were crossing the frontier in
enormous numbers, and the fact be
came apparent that fn this section the
main attack wns to come. This news,
flashed to Genernl Joffre, caused that
sudden alteration in bis plaps that
made possible the successful battles of
early September.

“Had it not been for thls operdtion
the French army would have concen.
trated for the Germaus in force on the
Alsace-Lorralne frontier, and the whole
territory, from Belgium to Paris and
Calais, would have been left open to
the'German onslaught—that is, the war
war would have ended according to the
calculations which had been so eare-
fully made in Germany.”

HIS OPINION OF LINCOLN.

It Was Well Founded, Ho Had Every
Reason to Believe.

I happened to be at Atlauta, Go., over
Lincoln's birthday, writes Jobn Kei:
drick Bangs in “From. Pillar to Post,”
and’ it pleased me beyond mensure to
find printed on the first page of one of
the prominent newspapers of that beau-
uful city a three column cut of Abra-
bam Lincoln, with a suitdble tribute in
verse. 2
_After eating my breakfast on -the
morning of the 11th I dallied for awhile
in the office %of the massive Georgian
Terrace hotel, smoking my cigar and
glancing over the news in the paper.
As T was about (o toss the paper aside
a flne old type of southern gentlemnn
seated himself on the divan alongside
me and fn the usual courteous manner
of the country gave me a morning salu-
tation.” -1 responded in kind and then

tapping my paper, observed: =

“That Is a fine pleture of Lincoln.”

“Yes, sub; a very fine picture, suh,”
he replied. “I never had the honor of
seein’ Mr. Linedln, sub, but from all I
hear, sub, he musg lave resembled that
picture pretty clc¥e, sub.” {

“It 19° Qelight to me to find ft in one
of your southern newspapers,” sald I,
“especially in one so influential in the
south as this.”

“Yes, sul he answered. “It show's
that the south is not slow. to recognize
genins, sub, wherever It 18 foumd, sul.
But,” he added’ “thero ts no occdslon
for surprise, sub. We have always ap-
preelateéd Mr. Lincoln's greatness down
here, and We have ddmired him, sub.
although we have, had reason to be
lieve that dorin’ the late unpleasant:
ness, guh, he was consid'rable of na
no'thern sympathizer, sub.”

 

“Freeze” at Airplanes’ Approach.

All soldiers are now instructed what
to do wher a hostile scouting airplane
is sighted by troops on the march.

On the warning “Airplane!” every
man drops on his right knee, with his
head bent well over the muzzle of his
rifle, which is held in a sloping position
in‘ front of the body. To look up is
fatal, for it creates a sed of white fuces.
All ranks then remain us motionless as
they possibly can until the airplane has
passed over them: In fact, they may
be sald to “freeze,” as wild animnla
freeze when seeking to evade observa-
tion.—London Mirror.

 

When the Paint Wears Off.

There are sometimes places ‘on the
exteriod of a house where the paint
gets Worm off and which cannot be re-
touched Yithout making a *'botch job"
