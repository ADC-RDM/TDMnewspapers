OLD SANTA CLAUS

Is usually to be found in a Dry Goods Store. He has
t been coming every year regularly to this store for 56 years.
He always comes back, because he knows he gets good,
relable merchandise here. He simply carts away Hand-'
kerchiefs, and even in war time he knows he is sure of
real Linen Table Cloths, Napkins and Towels and Towel- .
lings, notwithstanding the war has nearly driven such
articles out of the market altogether.

Then there are

Litile Dresses For Babies

And little girls, and big girls, too. Also Coats to keep
t Jack Frost out, and nice Woolen Stockings, Underwear
and Stocking Caps, and Gloves, Braces, Belts, Hair RiDh-
bons, and ever so many useful things that he thinks about
at the last minute, and he knows that if they are to be
found at all, there's no place more likely that B., M. & G.'s
big store.

Commencing with Saturday, the store will he open even-
ings till Christmas.

Please note that we will remain open until 10 o'clock
next Saturday evening
