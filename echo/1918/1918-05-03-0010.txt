ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZER

IN TOBACCO GROWING

During the season of 1917 fertilizer
tests were made on fifteen plats of
flue tobacco and. on fifteen ® plots of
sta-
tion; with the purpose of delgrmining
the value of the fertilizer for increas.
ing the yield, and also its effect an the

Burley tobacco, on thé Harrow

quality of the finished product.

In every case, with both types of
tobaoco, fertilizer of different formulae

were used, and the various plots were
managed and cultivated In suol
way as to make the fertilizer used
the anly factor affecting the Yicld and
quality of the tobacco grown in the
plot. The tobacco wad harvested and
kept separate until after it was atrip-
ped and weighed and the returns were
determined by the yields and price
for which the tobacco was sold,

No manure was uked in. conjunction
with the fertilizer and In each case a
plot was planted. to tobacco which
had neither been manured nor fertl.
ized fn any way.

The. fertilizer giving the best re-
sults with the flue tobacco, as regards
yleld and color had a formula con-
sisting of aprroximately 2% Ammonia,
5% Phosphoric Acid, and 21£ % Pot
ash, and was applied at the rate of
1 ton per acre. Thiy formula gave
an increase in yicld of 442 pounds of
tobacco per acre over the plot on
which no fertilizer was used; and
after deducting the cost of the fertil-
izer and the value of the tobacco
which would have been grown had no
Lt profit

of $119.10 per vere for using the fer-

tilizer.=

The fertilizer giving the best re-
sults on Burley hada formula con-
sisting of approximately 5% Ammonia,
3% Phosphoric: Acid, and 6% Potash,
and was used at the rate of 1 ton per
acre. This formula gave an, increased
yleld of 1230 pounds pér acre over
the plot on which no fertilizer was
used and a net profit of $215.10 per
acre for using the fertilizer.

Where a good coat of manure could
be applied the percentage of Ammonia
in the fertilizer, for Burley, could be
safely reduced considerably, thus low-
ering the jcost of the fertiifzer,

The results of two years' tests fn

Is the controlling factor in a large

be applied to the tobacco crop,

Editor of The Echo:—
nce upon a time when the man
who invented the: Caylight-Saving
Bill was a litle boy he always thought
he went to bed at nine o'clock, When
he got old enough to count he found
out when the clock struck eight times
his mother said: . “There now! It's
nine o'clock, jtime to ‘go to bed.” By
going to bed so early H¢ grew to ‘be
a very great and wise man so when
his country asked for a way to get
more work done in a day he invented
the Daylight Saving Bill, which
brought down blessings and curses
on his head. He had neyer Heard, P.
T. Barnum say “You can fool all of
the people some of the time and some
of the people all the ‘time, but you
can’t fool all the people all the time,”
This Daylight-Saving seems to be
very practical and work beautifully
in towns and cities where people
work by the clock, just for a given
number of hours, winter and summer
allke, and stop when the whistle
blows, no matter where the sun is.

But {t is different in the country.
There people work by the sun.. When
it gets up late they do; when it gets
up early, they do too, and work as long
as it does, at least. Ever since farm-
ing. became a popular outdoor sport
there has been a Daylight Saving
Bill, Henry or Martha on every farm
almost waking everyone up with the
sun and going toi bed when it got
dark, no matter lbw many hours there
were, and up to this year never had
an act passed asking them to, either

But when it comes to putting on the

clocks an hour they come to places
where it doesn’t work, not unless the
sun should keep the mew ‘act {which
up to present thne seems to be waking
no notice of It). Perhaps farmers are
slow at'seeing new fashions, bu: they
cannot seo themselves patting on the
clock an hour, rising at 3 or 4 o'clock
in the morning, getting the chores all
done so nice and early, then goin ¢ out
to the field and sitting on the fence
for an hour or two discussing “this
here war” with a 20c an hour fired
man, while they walt for the dew to
dry off the corn, hay, oats or whit

Mothers as a rule spend so much
time in Jooking after their children
and in household work that they over-
look the absolute necessity for that
rest and relaxation upon which their
health depends, “The consequence fs
that saon they find their health break-

household eareb quickly : thin the
blood and weaken the nerves. Then
follow headaches, feins in the side and
dark, swollen limbs, paipitation, a con-
stantly tired feeling, and often an in-
clination to fretfalness. These symp-
tons are the sign of poor blood, and
are the inevitable penalty of overwork
and over, anxiety in the care of chil-
dren and the affairs of the household.

Whenever a mother finds her health
