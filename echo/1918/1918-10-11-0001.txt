encountered ‘a gale gear thé Pelee

TERRIBLE FATALITY.

Mrs. Willlam Reeves and Daughter
Ella Instantly Killed at Cottam
by Electric Car, Saturday Evening

A distressing double fatality that
has thrown'Gosfleld North into mourn-
ing and-added two more to the long
Toll of thosé who have lost their lives
by being run down by cars on the W.,
E. & L. 8. electric rajlway, occurred
at Cottam Saturday evening about
615, when -Mra. Willlam Reeves and
daughter, Miss Ella, a well known
school teacher, were instantly killed
when the automobile in which they
were crossing the trae was struck
ibroadside by a car running at a high
rate of speed towards Kingaville. The
Indies had driven into Wm, Martison's,
just south of the village, to get some
tomatoes, and were returning when it
is thought their auto siglled on the
track by reason of tha rather steep
grade from the preciises ovar tho car
line. The electric car was within two
lengths of (thera when the inotorman
first saw’ the horror stricken woman,
and though be threw on the. brakes
‘and reverse, stopping the car in
fitty fect, the automobile ‘Was crump-
led up and swept under the car along
with Mrs, Reeves and crushed her al-
moat beyond recognition. &fiss Reeves

killed, though not mutilatad. “The car

Breaks All Records for Attendance
Peach of a Day Draws Nearly Five
Thousand to Capital of “Hapana
Belt” Wednesday—Good Show of
Stock—Races and Tug-of-War Big
Attractions,

Nearly five thousand people throng:
ed the Fair grounds .st Harrow on
Wednesday, the second day of the
Harrow Falr. Both days were among
the pleasantest this fall and people |:
took advantage of that to gather at
the township show, which has always
been known as the great annual hand-
shaking event of the County of Besex.
Every feature was pleasant, and ‘the
day was one round of joy. It was like
a motor show to see the hundreds of
automobiles parked around the inside
of the track. One director sald some-
thing as he looked over the dense
crowds from the judges’ stand when
he murmured: “This is a real Fair.”

The exhibits themselves were not so
plentiful as usun!, as it was simply
Impossible for farmers with their Inck
of help, to take the time to prepare
4 large display. However, everything
shown was meritorious. Horses were
light, and the judges fomnd them not
up to usual condition. The hot sum-
mer and: dry pasture had thefr, In-
fluence also on the cattle, but the
show. of these animals was large and
the fine dairy herds of Ferriss Bros.,
Ed. A. and Frank McGee, J. R. Pal
lard, were as good as could be found
in the county. A new exhibitor was
Orra C. Wigle with a herd of ‘Ayre-
shires. G. G. Gould, Herb. Harris
and A. J. Fox were the principal Short-
horn exhibitors, while James Martin
& Sons, of Malden, showed Polled
Angus. All the old sheep and swine
exhibitors, were out. _ The poultry
house was somewhat deficient fn
numbers. The show of corn and oth-
or seeds, roots and vegetables couldn't
be beaten by any Fair. Colchester
South will have a fine lot of seed corn
for shipment next winter and spring,
Some filme fruit was shown, Ladies’
work and dairy department were hign
class but not up to the mark fn en-
tries. 1

The Directors might vor: well tak
some of thelr surplus Sk] use ft to
remodel the main building, wnich is
not convenlent either for displays or
sightseers. Grinnell Bris. and Nord-
helmer planos and musical instra-
ments pleased the music loving. ‘The
other portion of the central part was
taken up with a very creditable dis.
play by F. E. Richardson and soa
Lyle, who were very busy all day ox-
plaining the merit of this or that
stove, ete. The new Kero-gas attach.
ment for stoves was a revelation to
many and {ts demonstration was an
Aftractive feature of’ the Fair. The
Women's Institute occupied ther ue-
ual checking corner.

pletely sold out before evening. The
