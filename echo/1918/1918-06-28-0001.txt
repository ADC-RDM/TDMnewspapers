ment to Rev. Major Edward Doe, re-
turned chaplain, “én Friday evening of
last week, by crowding the town hall
to the dodrs to listen to hia thrilling
recital of three years’ lifé at the
front, as chaplain of one of the Can-
adlan divisions. The address was un-
der the auspices of the local K. of C.,
and P, A, Barron was chairman, Fr.

der, but a calm, eareful chronological
recital of pho. war's progress as ho
had experibnced fit during his three
years in military service, from his

“| leaving Canada in the greatest of nll
Armadas, to the day he returned. His
vivid description of plgces he “had
served in, the experience of the Can-
adians with the varfo gnses and
hates of the Bosches; his miraculous
escapes from death in itg varled forms
caused shudders, to run’ through his
audience, while the teara were very
ngar as he pictured the burial of our
dead heroes, and the gréut care tak-
en to mark their graves for all time to
coma. 5

At the conclusion 3¢ Tr. Doe's stir-
ring’ address, Mr. ‘Auld moved a
hearty vote of thanks both- to him
