“Two “dozen. young people of the vlil-
lage tendered Stanley Plant, of the
Imperial Bank, a kindly and warm
farewell at the lake, Friday, before his
departure for a military training

camp, It took the form of 4 picnic
and was thoroughly enjoyed, except
|for the undércurrent of sadness which
|accompanies one af these “goodbyes.”
Otto Ferriss, on behalf of the com-
pany, presented Stan with a “wrist
watch, prefacing the presentation with
a very appropriate speech. The re-
cipient made a suitable acknowledge-
ment. Carmen Husser, who also late-
ly enlisted, unexpectedly Joined the
picknickers and was ‘warmly wel
|comed. A bountiful lunch was served
by the girls of the party.

Harrow merchants have sgttled the
much, discussed question of early clos-
ing and summer half holidays, by sign.
ing the following agreement, which is
self explanatory: “We the under-
signed business men of Harrow, agrea
to close our respective places of busi-

 

 

ness during the months of Jan., Feb.,
March, April, May, Sept, Oct, Nov.
and Dec. on Tuesday and Thursday

nights at the hour of six o'clock, slow
time, and we: hereby further agree to
close our sald. places of: business dur-
ing the months of June, July and Aug-
ust on Tuesday night at the hour of
six o'clock,
at the hour of twelve o'clock (noom),
slow time, excepting in case or cases
of. emergency due to sickness, death
or accident, under a penalty-of no less
than Fifty Dollars, and not to exceed
Fifty Dollars. And it {s hereby fue
ther agreed that any violation ‘of the
{above agreement is to bE tried by a
committee of three outsiders, one to
be appointed by the offender, ‘one by
the business men, and-thoy to choose
& third, and all penalties, {f any, col-
lected are to be divided equally am-
ong the different patriotic societies of
Harrow and- Colchester South. And
ft is further agreed that the sale of
gasoline be permitted at any time
from tanks stationed [n the street
only.” This is a definité step to take
and any one who has subscribed to
the above will hesitate before lightly
breaking his pledged word, or laying
himself open to prosecution under the
terms of the agreements The former
early closing agreement had become
a very. much scoffed at. “scrap of
paper.” . !
