Is Your

Dining Room Floor a
.of Embarassment ?

— Perhaps dull, seratched, rough or otherwise unattrictive. Armstrong's
Linoleums in any one of the numerous patterns that accurately reproduce
wood grain will solve the problem economically and with the most artis-
tic results. This is an exceedingly durable floor covering—easier to take
care of than either painted or polished weod floors. Many attractive

designs now in stock.

Cleanliness in the Kitchen

Is a matter of much unpleasant
work when it comes to floors,
unless they are covered with
Armstrong's Linoleum. It pro-
vides a bright, cheerful floor
covering that is so readily kept
spic and span that dirt simply
can't accumulate, Thoroughly
good, but not expensive, and a
variety of patterns from which
to choose.
