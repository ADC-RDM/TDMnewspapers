of tho Karr family’s claim to
any of the * property occupied by

it. ‘The facts In connection with the
disposal of this property are. as fci-
lows:
tal thera 46 years ago; he bought the
|'place, the deed being made out to his
wile, on A mMOrtguge held by the late
Daniel Wright. Mr. Wright had to
toreclose-the mortgage, and the prop-
erty was sold by him to James Rae,
uncle of the late Mrs. Thomas Fer-
risa, Mr. Rae after sold it to
Frenchman, Who kept a tavern there,
|and he to the late John Thrasher, who
also managed the hotel for some time.
Mr. Thrasher sold # to John McAfeo,
who tors down the old log bullding
and built a frame store, and sold itto
He W. Allan, M.P., late Inspector of
Customs for Windsor District. T. B.
Adam$, the present owner, bought ft
trom him. This' entirely disposes of
the story that any outsider has. any
claim to the property.

Audrey Jean, little danghter of Mr.
and Mrs. Earl Stephens passed away
Thursday evening of last week from
the effacts of some Qillet's lye, which
she took into her mouth Wednesday
noon before, while her mother was in
the housé getting the cirild a drink.
The lye was being used in washing
and had been left on the porch. The
mother had no sooner turned her back
to enter the house when the little girl
slipped out, and childlike grasped the
can and put It up to her mouth to
drink {t. A quantity ot. the powder
entered her mouth and badly Burned
her. In spite of all that could be
done, she gradually grew weaker until

death came,

noon By Rey. Mr. Edington, and the
remains were taken to Greenhill
cemetery for burial, the=pallbearers
