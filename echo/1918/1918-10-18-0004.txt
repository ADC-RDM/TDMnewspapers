and how to care for influenza, which
is all summed up in the two clauses:
“The great danger is from pneumonia.
Avoid it by staying in bed while actu-
ally 111 and until convalescence is
fully established. The after effects of
influenza are worse than the disease.
Take care of yourself.”

Lord Shaughnessy has resigned cs
president of the Canadian Pacific Rail-
wily, and js succeeded in this office
by E. W. Besattty. K.C, vice-president.
Lord Shaughnessy will retain the
post of chairman of the board of direc-
tors. Sir George Bury rotires from his
office as vice-president on acronnt of
ill-health, and $s succeeded by Grant
Hall, who has been vice-president in
charge of wesiern lines.

modities.
