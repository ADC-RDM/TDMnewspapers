LEAMINGTON WATERWORKS.

 

A special meeting of the Leaming-
ton council was held Saturday night
to receive a.repart from Engineer
"Newman and the special committee
on the construction of the proposed
new 900,000-gallon reservoir.

It was proposed at one time to pur-|.
chase A. Allen's liouse and lot ad-
joining the waterworks at a cost of
$3,000 and Mrs, Munday's house and
Jot ot the redr for $1,100, and con-
struct two rectangular reservoirs at
an estimated cost of $45,000.

It was afterwards discovered that a
better réinforcement of circular reser-
voirs could be secured than for rect:
angular ones, and the report of En-|
gineer Newman and the Special” Com-
mittee, Saturday night, dealt with the
former,

The’ report covered the proposal to
now congiruct two circular reservoirs,
each with a capacity of 450,000 gal-
lons connécted by pipe, giving a total
capacity of 900,000 gallons. - For this
purpose it is proposed to purchase the
following properties ffonting on the
south side of Hazelton street, at the
rear of the waterworks and a little
west: *Mrs. Mundays' house and lot,
$1,100; J. F. Rupert's house and lot,
$1,700; Lorne Nicholls lot without
the house, $1,200, and Wm. Truax's
house and lot, $1,800. In addition to
theses properties a corner of James
Bvans' lot will be required and a
sright of way for a pipe line {rom
Clark street. THe estimated cost of
the circular reservoirs, Including. the.
purchase of thekproperties mentioned
and an additional three feet to the
present reservoir is $39,000, ~or a
saving of $6,000 as compared with
the copt of $45,000 for the rectan-
gular reservoirs,

The report was adopted and the
council passed a resolution to pur:
chase the properties referred to and
gecure permisiion for the same from
the Finance Minister at Ottawa.

The ‘combined capacity of the new
and old reservoirs will be 1,065,000
2 llgallons, which meets the require-
ments of the Fire Underwriters’ As:
sociation up to a population of 5,000,
