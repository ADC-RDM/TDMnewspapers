Judging by the present activity in
our littie thriving village, one would
think that we were on Michigan Ave,
Chicago. or on street, New York.
But do not be deceived, my dear read-
er, wiat you see here are not limou-
sinea, but" procession of heavy loads
of tomatoes, wending their way to-
wards Canning Factory. The
farmers are jubflant, a little fortune
Is awaiting them, reward of (heir
labor upder a hot summer sun. D.
C. Munro, manager of the Valley Can-
ning Co, of this place, Is all smiles,
although he has his factory running
night and day to keep up with the
increasing delivery of the red “Pomme
d'Amour.” If no early frost is felt and
reatier permits, it will be one of the
hegt years for the tomato growersyand
for the canning industry In this sec-
tion. The Helnz Co. is not having the
same suceesa. Whether this Is due to
ge hot and dry summer or’ to the
erence of the growers, we do
n ov, but we are.inclined to be-
llave that it is due to both. Farmers
d9 not get discouraged at this first
quas! failure, but let the company, by
giving it another trigl. show you that
the cucumber industry is‘a paying
one for you. When the big sugar fac-
tory waa bullt at Wallaceburg, hs
farmers of Lambton and Kent counties
were vefy suspicious of the good
storiesArelated Lo them-by the agents’
of the company after the first'and gee-
ond failure, but at last they learzsd
to grow sugar beets, and to-day they

pay to have the work done—Accord-
ing to all appearances, Labor Day
will be a gala day at Lofselleville
Great preparations are belag made for
the big picnic which will be held here
on that day. There will’ be amuse
ments of all kinds. Refreshments
will be served on the grounds. A good
