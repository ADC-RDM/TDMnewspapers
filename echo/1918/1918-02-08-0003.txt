‘CRITICISING A CRITIC.

A Little Sermon on the Uso of “Slow”
y ap an Advarb. :

A Brooklyn man writes to a Manhat-
tan morning paper in great distress he
cause signs by the roadside commonly
say, “Automobiles Go Slow.” Tho writ
er thinks the amount of paint and labor

"required ‘to change the adjective to an

| adverb would be very insignificant as
compared with the purifying of a na- |
tion's speech.”

But if purifying the speech means
dropping the use of “slow” as an ad- |
verb let us be thankful the purifiers
did not got busy before the great Eng-
lish authors began to write, The mod-
ern purifiers, or Innovators, would de-
prive us of Milton “swinging slow with
sullen roar” and compel Shakespeare
to rewrite the first three linea of “Mid-
summer Night's Dream.”

“Slow” as an adverb has been in lit-
erature since the year 1500. It is found ;
in Byron, Thackeray and the Edin- '
burgh Review. Johnson's Dictionary
of 1773 quotes numerous examples of
its use by Donne, Milton and Pope. It
seems us If it ought to be especially
suitable in an automobile warning sign.
For cannot old fashioned people (not
“purifiers”) remember the couplet in
Marmion?”

~And come ho slow or come he fast
It ip but death who comes at last,

The English language will. continue
to be a noble and forceful means of
expressing thought if it remains proof

MENSTRUATION PREPARATION,

HE FOLLOWING REMARKS concerning an important natural
function of women’ is published by Dr. Effie Lobdell in The
Chicago Tribune. Their value, if the suggestions are carried out,
will be 80 great that no apology is offered for their publication,

Functioning Without Discomfort.

About three years ago I chanced to pick up a copy of the magazine,
“Physical Culture,” and read an article written by a business woman who -
claimed to have trained herself into health befitting her duties, and out of
the physical infirmatives so common te women in all phases of life during
their most efficient years. ‘

These infirmities are so common as to be accepted as a traditional
necessity. They are used as one of the most common arguments showing
why women can never compete wholly with men in work or business, and
therefore can never be estimated by the same wage or salary scale.

I decided to work out a plan I could recommend to any woman patients”
to carry through these physical phases with the least possible evidence to
others and discomfort to themselves. In the three years of observation I
am” able to state that with the intelligent woman who will co-operate with
me I have had astounding results. ; :

“My observations cover the girls and women employed in stores and
factories, the oflice women in positions where the tension on nerves is more
marked because of greater responsibllities, and the Women (n professional

the celebrated chemist of the Rue
