tically all deaths, except thome due
to accident or old age,

Fortunately we have discovered
comparatively simple methods of
combating the effects of what - are
called pathogenic (disease-produc-
ing) bacteria, These may be stated
in a few short rules as follows:

1. Milk which fs consumed in a
raw condition must be drawn only
from cows which are healthy.

2. As soon as the milk {8s drawn
from the cow, It should be cooled to
60 degrees or lower, and be kept at
that temperature until consumed.

3. All pails, strainers, dippers,
milk bottles, pitchers, ete, which
come in contact with the milk, must
bo thoroughly washed and preferably
steamed, or be rinsed after washing
In a chloride solution, which has been
found to be one of the best germi-
cides,

4. Milk should not be exposed to
the air any longer than absolutely
necessary, as this seeds the milk with
a fresh lot of germs, This means
the keeping of milk (n a closed. ves-
sel and not ln an open dish,

6. "Left over” milk from meals
should not be put into the gemeral
supply, as this causes the whole lot
to spoll.

6. “Left over” milk from the sick
room should be pasteurized or de-
stroyed, ns It may spread disease.

7. Milk at all times and in all
places should, be kept ‘clean’ and
“‘cool.”—Prof.  H. H. Dean, Ontario
Agricultural College,

Stock during the heat of the day,
though they may damage the young

18 to keep (he cattle In a darkens (V]
stable for"part of the day. This means
a good deal of extra labor cleaning
the stable, and keepirs the cows
clean, and under present Inbor con-
ditions may not be practicable on
many farms. Houweyer, where there

Water Necessary for Comfort and
Milk Production,

Cows frequently Buffer from lack
of sufficient water,. As a boy, the
writer remembers driving cattle to
“Blg Griek;" in Brant County, during
dry spells, The cewal were nearly
famished when they reached (he
“Crick” and would arink until they
looked like burst! By the ume

they reach home, after walking for Published under the Authority of

The
the cattle were necafly as thirsty as of
ever. 4

The only safe sgurce of a surc {
water supply Is'a dgep well, driven E
or bored, and havingithe water pump-
ed by windmill: or other sources of
power, with a storage tank for ewer- '
gencles. There Is ng part of Ontario
in whiclr an abundance of water can-
not be obtained, if we go deep
enough to tap the hidden sources of
supply. é

No matter how ‘it Is cbtalned, the
owner of dairy stock, more especial-
ly of cows milking, must supply a
large amount uit water, else the stock
will suffer, whijch means lessened |
milk supply, andi small cheques from
the creamery, cheesery, condensery,
or city, dealer. Milk consists of about
87% per cent. water, and this water
must ¢ome from the drink And feed
of the cow. A cow giving 100 lbs.
(10 gallons) of milk duly, will drink
over 200 lbs. (20 gallon) of water
in a'day. Cows giving less milk will
drink In proportion. ‘Give the cows
plenty of water. Young cattle, calves,
and hogs also need. plenty of clean
water In bot weather, J

Fly Remedies. ¥

There are several good fly réme-
dies on the market. Where there is
no time to make one, the purchase
of a patent fly-killer or repellent, is
advisable. « These are usually applied
dally, or twice a doy with a small
hand sprayer. .

A home-made remedy may consist
of" one-half gallon fish ofl, or any old
grease, one-half pint coal ofl, ‘and
four tablespoonfuls of e¢rude car-
sbollc acid, cresol, ete. Mix thor-
oughly. This will be sufficient for
twenty-five cows and may be applied
with a brush or cloth. ff there's
no rain it will keep the flies off for
several days, Milkers must be care:
ful not to get this onthe hands, |
tor allow hairs to drop Into the milk
pail, as it will taint the milk, It is
safer to apply after milking. —Prof:

Roguing Potatoes.

The average yield of potatoes per
acre in the Province of Ontario for
the past thirty-six’ years has been
about 115 bushels. The yields vary
greatly. In 1917 there were varl-
ations In .Ontarfo from twenty-five
or less up to seven hundred bushels
per acre. People are realizing more
and more that for high yields of po-
tatoes conditions must be favorable,
It is fmportant to have good fertile
. | 8011 well cultivated and to plant a
liberal supply of seed of the best
varieties at the proper time.  -Seed
potatoes somewhat immature” which
bave been produced in a cool cll-
mate, and which are comparatively
free from disease, are apt to furnish
seed of high quality, Even under
these, conditions; It 1s well to care-
fully Inspect the seed before plant-
ing- and to thoroughly rogue the
growing crop.

A potato field Is rogued by remov-
ing the undesirable plants. A thor-
uogh roguing of the grdwing crop
once or twice during the summer is
one of the most effectual ways in
ridding the field of a humber of the
potato diseases, This operation would:
also insure the {mmediate. removal
of the weak and unthrifty plants
which are sure to produce undersiz-
able seed. Potato growers sometimes
go through their flelds and remove
all plants which are not true to type.
| Thorough rogulng is one of the best
methods of securing pure, healthy
seed of high quality.—Dr.C. A. Zav-
itz, Ontario Agricultural College:

represents that surplus strength.

“Exercise the Breeding Stock.

Exercise is ébsential for all male
breeding stock. At certain seasons
of the year It {8 an easy matter to
arrange for ample exercise for the
stallion, the. bull, the boar, or the
ram. At other times it is rather dif-
ficult and frequently little or, no
exercise 1s given, or If given too much
freedom occasionally, harm to
Biro is the result.”

The bull should not be allowed te
run loose in the pasture with the
cows. In the first place it is a dan-
gerous custom, as it gives abundant
opportunity for the bull to attack a
person, unawares or where escape Is
dificult. Further, a: récord of the
date of breeding of the cows cannot
“be kept and no herd can be handled |
to tho best advantage without these
records,
