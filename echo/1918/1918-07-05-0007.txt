od. In spite of a series of unfavorable
seasons, dating back to 191%, their
quality: has jmproved to such -an
extent that they are considered as
good as the imported product, except
for certain high grades which, even
in the Southern States, represents
only » small proportion’ of the total
production.

The White Burleys of Ontario are
largely used in this country for the
munufactfire of plug tobacco (chew-

definitely overcome. They: can be
produced in large quantities in sdme
parts of the Province of Quebec where

tobacco 1s still rather limited, but
can oasfly be Increased and there Is
no doubt as to the future of Canadian
binders.

Coming back to cigar fillers it may
be said it is from these that depend
to a large extent the taste and aroma
of a cigar, For long time the
only Canadian fillers put on the mar
ket were obtained from varieties of
tobacco not specially grown for that
purpose. They mostly included top
leaves of Comstock Spanish, too short
for use as bindors, or broken leaves
which, ‘ though sound, were also un-
suitable for binders. As a rule these
tobaccos are strongly fermeénted, es-
pecially the top leaves considered as
a little heavy, and put on the market
as finished as possible, mostly as
“stripped fitters”, practically ready
for use, In order to séduce the cigar

has increased considerably during the
last few years,

thelr use.
The success of thése stripped Can-

adlan fillers has been great and rapid.

"On the other hand the growing of , Their taste s light, and while there is

bright tobacco of the Virginia type
has, in spite of the unfavorable
wenther conditions of the past’ few
years, made rapid progress on certain
lands of Southern Ontario considered
as [nsufficlently fertile for the produc-
tion of a normal crop of White Burley.
. These tobaccos are flue cured in
special barns known as
thorough curing of a crop requiring
from 3% to 6 days according to the
condition of the leaf when harvested.
A bright color is ‘what is specially
ajmed at and the higher proportion
of bright tobacco jn a crop the great-
er {ts value. Unless the season Is
favorable to a thorough and early rip-
ening the best results cannot be ex-
pected, as the tobacco must yellow
up on the “hill” before being taken
{nto.sthe curing barn.

The best proof of the progress mide

nothing special jn the aroma they are
well suited for blending purposes,
which enables the manufacturer to use
them in comparatively high. clags
cigars, It is not indiscreet to say that
these Canadian fillers: are being used
In the manufacture of cigars which,
beford the changes in the tariff, were

kilns, the |belng retailed at a price well above

five cents apiece.

In order to further meet the “re-
qfiirements of the cigdr industry we
came to the conclusidn that it might
prove feasible to acclimatize in this
country some varieties of tobacco used
especially as fillers.

To this end the Tobacco Division
has, since 1910, been experimenting
with the following varieties: Cuban,
Brazilians, Aurora, Zimmer Spanish,
Mexican. . Philippines, etc, all of
which are considered as good fillers In

in the handHng of this type of tobacco | the countries from which they origin:

ig the higher proportion of bright leaf
obtained during the comparatively un-
“favorable season of 1917-1918." It Is
certain that the growers of Essex
and Kent and gradually getting
a better idea of the type of soll re-
quired for the production of bright
tobaccos; ag well as becoming more
familiar with the cultural methods
and the curing process.

The former duty of 28 cents per
pound has greatly helped Canadian
Burleys, ‘but Canadian flue cured to-
baccos, on account of the higher prices
paid for that type of leaf on the Amer-
jcan market, were in a somewhat less
favorable position, which {8 now great-
ly improved by the. increase in duty
from 28 to 40 cents per pound.

The additional protection given the
Canadian leaf can only further develop
the growing of flue cured tobaccos in

“}:Ontavio, It is difficult to estimate to

what extent at present, but they will
certainly be in much greater demand
in the near future. There are plenty
of sdils suitable for the growing of
that type of tobacco in the northern
shore of Lakes Brie and = Ontarlo,
where the climate is generally favor: |
able. This Is where the industry has

| started and where it wHl probably éx-

pind very soon. .
. Theré™s another type of tobacco

which so far has been very little grown |

in Canada and for which there will
so be a great deynand, the fire cured
tobacco, whose American prototype is
widely known as Green River.

~Heavier lands than those which
have so far been chosen for theigrow-
ing of ordinary White Burley can be

devoted to this type. They cover large |
areas in Southern Ontario in the very |

centre “of the tobacco growing dis-
tricts, and the farmers, who have made
a specialty :of this” industry. will be
able to devote to the Green River
type soils which have up till now been
considered as unsuitable for the grow-
ing of tobacco. &
18 fire curing process requires
‘2 practice, but it is more easily
tered than the flue curing pro-
+, which has unitl now heen left in
v4, hands of experts. Therefore there
{soon be more ‘tobacco produced
he tobacco growing districts of
‘arlo, or new centres created in
4r to meet ‘the larger demand.

ate.
The product which was obtained in

Canada was, in every instance, quite

| aromatic, particularly when the crop
| was produced from directly (mported

goed . It was Important to verify this,
especiflly as far as the Cubans ware
concerned, as it is claimed that the

| aroma of tropical tobaccos degenerate

very rapldly when they are transferred
tora temperate climate.

The deterioration of the aroma can-
not take place with filer tobaccos or
the United States such as the Zim-
mer Spanish, the Aurora, and gener-
ally speaking the Ohto and -Pennsyl-
vanin fillers. As to the tropical varie-
ties~Cuban, Brazilians, Mexican and
Philippines—the greatest difficulty
encountered was the pcclimatizing of
the type, or securing a yield per acre
large enough to induce the Canadifin
farmers to grow-them at the prevall-
ing market price. ;

Decided progress has been made In
that direction, espaclally with the
Cubang, © It {8 no usa trying to pro-
duce these tobaccos fn Canada direct
from imported.seed. As a rule the
vitality of the Iatter ia so poor that it
fs almost impossible jo secure ‘a good
stand on the seed-beds, It is there-
fore necessary.to usd Canadian seed
of first or second generation, which
has “become acclimnfizéd and which
coming from selected: plants, produce
@ much more uniform crop.

Some selections pe Brazilian and
Mexican tobuccos e proved good
ylelders. “Gens, ~aroma of the
Brazilians has béen_ found: ‘satisfac-
tory, but until. now the quantity of
Mexican tobacco produced on our
experimental plots has mot been large
enough to allow us, or, the manufac-
{ turers, who. have tried”{t, to form a
\ definite opinion of {ts quality.

Two varieties of Philippine tobac-
cop, the Espada and Habana, seem also

very promising. Some test cigars
made of Espada” have prgved rather
mild, of agreeable taste, similar to that
‘of good ‘Manilla cigars. The Espada,
however, seems rather difficult to gg-
climatize in Canada, at Jeast {t groat-
lly suffered’ in the field from the ad-
verse conditions of 1916 and 1917. The
Habana seems to adapt. itself more
readily to the climatic conditions ,ot
this country. 1t yields a leaf-a 1Htla
larger-than that of thé Cuban, of the
same shape, but a’ little thinner. . As
forthe Mexican the quintity of Philip-
pine tobaccos which. we have so far
been, able to handle has been rather
too, small to allow us to express a
{ definite opinion as to their merits as
cigar fillérs.

Special attention has been pald to
!the cigar filllers of Southern Ohfo—
Zimmer Spanish, Lottle Dutch and Aur-

{ora—in order to ascertain how they

would. behave in thls country.
The Aurora has produced a good
sized leaf, a little thick,swhich has the

to what ix known in the trade as cloar
Havanas. :

If the growing of ' tobacco under
shade wero to be found practical. in
this country the Yamaska would very
probably prove a well sulted variety
for this purpose, at léast aa well as the
selections of Cuban which are used
in Connecticut. While it is admitted
that the Cpbans grown under shade
lose practically all their original
aroma, which makes them only vialu-
able as cigar wrappers, it is possible
that the Yamaska, not being a tropi-
«cal variety, when grown under shade,
would, when grown under shade,
maintain more of Its characteristics.
That will enable the farmer to make
a ‘better use of his crop.

A variety of Belgian tobacco, the
"Obourg. long leaf”, which has been
known for a number of years in this
country as a pipe tobacco, has
cently been tried as a cigar filler.

In spite of Its special aroma, whidh
i3 quite distinct from what {8 usually
looked for In cigar fillers, this var-
{ety scems to have some prospects in
this country. It Is very thrifty and a
good ylelder: .

However, the packers who would
like to handle that Belgian tobacco
should make a careful selection in
order to submit to different processes
the top, the middie and the bottom
leaves. The aroma of the top leaves
{s rather strong, too loud and pretty
close to the well known flavor of the
Canadian Canelle. That part of the
chop should be put aside to be used in
aromatic pipe tobacco. But the aroma
of the middle leaves {8s very nice, and
that part of the crop can certainly be
used in the manufacture of cigars.
The bottom leaves comdd be tested by
the process now (n use for the prepar-
ation of stripped fillers- In order to
maintain an aroma of the Canadian
fillers {t will probably be necessary
to ferment them not so energetically
as has often been the case.

Bulk fermentation with two rebulk-
ings for the top leaves, one for the
middle, jmmediately followed by a
packing into ordinary boxes, when
the leaves are still quite supple, and
of a finishing jn the sweat room, for
about a month; has proved a satisfac-
tory method.” A small lot of Zimmer
Spanish fram the crop of 1917 was
subjected to this process, The re-
sult was that the top leaves ‘(rather
thin ft is true) were considered as
ready for. use only four months after
they had been delivered to the ware-
houses. ,

The handling of the various types
of Canadian tobacco in order to make
them suftable for.-cigar purposes {s
one of the most Important problems,
Canadian tobaccos, owing to the in-
flugnce\of the climate, are in a class
by them¥elves and little {s yet known
as to the best way of treating them
In the warehouses. The Tobacco Di-
vision is paying a great deal of at-
tention to this question. =

So far the ‘Tobacco Division has
only been able to approach thé Can-
adlan ‘'manufacturesr who seemed
specially Interested in the domestic
leaf. However, it is expected that a
8till greater Interest will soon be
shown dn a number ‘of Canadian to-
baccos, ‘the merits ‘of which are not
yet sufficiently known. Several var-
letles of filler tobaccos will be grown
this year at the Experimental Stations
of St. Jacques l'Achigan and Farn-
ham, Que. While ft will take some
time before an opinion can be ex-
pressed on the relative merits of the
finished product, : the manufacturer
who may become Interested, especially
those near Montreal, will have plenty
of facilities for seeing in the fleld how
those tobaccos behave {n this coun-
try.

The scason has begun well, under
rather favorable conditions. The segd-
beds have produced a large number of
plants and everything points to a
larger acreage than in 1917.

The high prichs paid for the crop of
1917 have induced many farmers to
greatly increase, their tobacco acre-
age in 1918. However, the labor short-
age may prevent them from doing so.
Even, should this problem be solved
to the satisfaction of the farmer it
would Dg better. for him fo limit hj )

one can safely cure fs taking very
serious risk,

It is expected that.a cértain number
of manufactufers-who until now have
never tried the Canadian leaf will ex-
periment with It very soon. Perhaps
the Canadian crop of 1918, especially
as regards cigar tobaceos, will not be
suflicient to ‘meet the requirements of
the trade, at least the Canadian ETOwW-
er should meet his new customers with
crops. better cared for than ever, He
should do his best to prove to the new
