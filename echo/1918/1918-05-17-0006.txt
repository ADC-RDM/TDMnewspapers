—The boys who work on farms this
summer will learn one thing that the
old stable of square measure omitted
the number of aches in an acre.

= Parkhill Gazette: “We arextold
that it does not pay a farmer to rilse
hogs any more, Two men in Parkhill
who raised hogs summer’ think
differently. Each of these men raised
two hogs and Bought practically every-
thing the hogs ate. Each man sold
one hog and saved the other hog for |
the use of his family. In each case,
not only.did the one hog, which was
sold pay for the ‘¢xpen
the two hogs but there
surplus of money to the good, Sa if
a man can raise two hogs for the price
of one, that is a Jiundred per cent,
profit, is it not? town man can do
that, a farmer should be able=to do
better.

—The cancellation of all exemptions
of men between the ages of 20 and
22 {8 seriously affecting the railroads
in London, Ont., and officials there of
both the C.P.R. and Grand Trunk are
finding it a dificult task -to fill the
places of men drafted. The Grand
Trunk is more seriously affected than
any other road passing through the
city, as 12 telegraph operators in that
district will have to report for ser-
vice during the next couple of weeks.
So far the chief despatcher has not
been able to find operators ta take the
places of the drafted men and it is
quite possible that a number of offices
will have to be closed. Several of the
brakemen have also been ordered to
report. Farming is not the only indus-
try struck hard by the new draft law.
+—A despatch from Guelph says:—
“Farmers of this district who pur
chased large quantities of flour re-
cently expect (0 have to return it, in
compliance with the ruling of the food
board. Many of the farmers had
enough flour to do them for a year.
A Government inspector has been fn
the district for several days. Quite
a number of Guelph citizens who laid
in larger stocks of flour than the law
allows will have to take it back also.
A case in Puslinch township {8s being
cited here. About a year ago a farmer
purchased about 200 bags of flour, it
is stated, for which he paid $6.50 per
hundred. 1t {8 stated that he has
been notified by the Dominjon auth-
orities that the greater part of the
flour must be shipped without delay
to Montreal, from which port it will
be sent overseas, where jt is badly
needed. The man endeavored to se-
cure a full carload of flour at the
time he bought the other, it js stated.
The thing which hits him the hardest,
however, Is that he must accept the
pr nt market price, which is $6.”

NEW SYSTEM OF WRITING COM.
ING IN?

 

“Print” Method Adopted. in Some of

the London Schools.

 

Several London schools have =
duced a new system of writing known
as. “manuscript” or “print” writing,
which-replaces the former vertical or
Spencerian systems. In the mew sys-
tem the «children {mitate the form of
printed chardctérs, and ft is claimed
that the task of learning to write
Jegibly is greatly shortened and sim-
plified by the ‘leaving out of the un-
necessary connecting tpstrokes.

The new system was first intro-

duced in military, establishments for
convalescent soldiers, originating in
the desire to find a method of writing
which could be quickly learned by sol-
diers who had lost the use of their
right hand. Its advoeates claim that
the “print” writing as easy to learn,
neat, legible and speedy, and ‘that it
| removes the, great disadvantages of
two kinds of letters with which the
child has to contend in learning to
read and to write

In a pamphlet issued by the Child

Study Soclety of Lendon, Dr. .L. C.
Kimmins, chief inspector of the Lon-
don Education Cepartment, calls the

new system “the writing of the fu-
ture.”
