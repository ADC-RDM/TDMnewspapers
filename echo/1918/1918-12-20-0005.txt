HE passenger conch was
filled with a merry
crowd and the Christ-
mas spirit was brond-
ly manifested. Lugguge
racks were filled with
bundles giving out the
perfume of flowers;
here the head of a doll,
there the wheels of a
toy peeped out. Some
Jovial travellng men
weére discussing thelr

welcome home and girls on college va-
cation bandied gay repartee. All was
mirth and happiness—except with one,

Shrinking back .into a dark corner
of the car was a bronzed young man.
The face under the drooping som-
brero bore a wistful, -anxlous expres-
slon. He went out to the platform as
the train slowed up, leaped to the
ground, skirted the main rtroet,
evaded a brilllantly lighted church
where some Christmas eve festivity
was In progress and reached a house
set In the center of a large lot. He
galned the shadow of a great ever-
green tree,

The forlorn lurker ventured a few

forting sigh and something about “the
folks probably being at the church,”
adding: “I can watch. and walt, I
wonder if the old hideout in the tree Is
atlll there?” He reached for n branch,
lifted himself aloft, scrambled up the
trunk and came to where n few boards
formed a platform. He had placed it
there when an boy. It trembled from
age as he crept upon it.

“Three years,” he whispered, dream-
fly. “Christmas eve, home, and—
what?”

He had left this selfsame spot a run-
away, he had returned like some fear-
filled fugitive. How vividly he recalled
his Inst day at home! He and others
had been playing ball next to the home
of wenlthy Judge Earll, A cheer hod
greeted his strike which sent the
sphere whirling. It landed aguinst a

window, crashed through it and a min-
ute later there appeared a palefaced,
exclted servant, waving his arms wild-
ly and shouting out:

“Who did It? It has gone through
the judge's most valuable puinting that
cost him two thousand dollars” .

A wild thought came to Jasper. Tt
would ruin his father to pay that big-
two thousand dollars. Ah! he would
earn it himself, Longingly l¢ glanced
at the vine-clusterell* cottage where
lived Edna Marsh, his first love, his
“girl.” Half an_hour later he was
‘huddled 1A a boxear, going west. ~~

Then three years, weary, tollsome,
with no word from home. He had been
lured to the gold diggings! Most days
he picked up flakes and nuggets worth
a dollar or more. Twice he was. lucky.
He lived at the cheapest rate. In his
snnkeskin belt he stored {he preclous
dust. Theh, just before Christmas, the
call of home was not to be resisted.

With a shock he aroused, chilled nnd
confused. Lantern lights dazzled him
from below. He made out hislf a dozen
forms. One was swinging an ax, It
sunk deep Into the base of the tree,

“Take turns!” called out a sten-
torlan voice. “Let gll hands haven
chance at cutting ‘down the biggest
Christmas tree In town. How she will
tower on the common tomorrow night,
all olive with colored electric globes
and gifts for the kids!”

“Hold on!” enlled down Jasper Wal-
den, missed a clutch ‘and fell to the
snowy ground. :

, He opened his eyes to find himself

lying on a couch in the house, his fa- |

ther, mother and sister bending over
him_ with solicitous care and there,
clinging to his sister's arm, pale and
anxious, was his boyhood ‘love, pret-
tier than “ever—Edna Marsh.

“My boy; Oh, my boy, heaven fs.
kind!” cried his mother, *

Jasper unshipped the snnkeskin belt,
“Father,” he sald, “it's full of gold. It
willypay for Judge Earll'Sstwo thou-
sand-dollar pleture.” *

“What! that sent you away?” cried
