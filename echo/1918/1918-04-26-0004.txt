Times are not like what they were when we could telegraph an
order for several pieces of such-and-such fabric and have it here in
theee or four days. Much less can we now hope to romew all our
present stocks at former prices; although it i= quite true some
standard cotton materials will remain at early season prices for a
ittle while at least. But better come early and avoid any disap-
pointments.

Among the pretty things are Fancy Volles in dress lengths, silk
and cotton mixtures, including the popular dark effects, $6.00, $8.00,

$8.50, $9.00 pattern.
