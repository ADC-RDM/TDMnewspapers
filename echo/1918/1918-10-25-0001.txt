BURG, ONTARIO, FRIDAY,

. WILSON SAYS “SURRENDER.”

All doubts as to just what course
President Wilson might take with re
gard to Germany's latest pence note
were set asjde yesterday when his
reply was dispatched through the
Swiss Minister. Briefly it sald to the
“Surrender,” the matter of
an armistice is up to the Allles, and
the terms of surrender are up to Gen-
eral Foch. This is very satisfactory
to the whole world outside the Cen-
tral Powers.

Sir Douglas Halg's forces are driv-
Ing on at a terrific rate [n Belgium,
both Vallenciennes and Ghent having
fallen before his armies. The French
are also conquering all before them.
Germany threatens to Oppose all ad-
vances at the Rhine and‘ mliljtary
critics now fofecast that a drive on
Germiny will follow from the east.

AMHERSTBURG LUCKY,
v

While there are 4 few scattering
cases of the “Flu” In Amherstburg,
some of (which are serious enough, so
far this town has been very lucky in
respect to the epidemic that Is having
such dread consequences throughout
the country, and for this we as a
people should be truly thankful. Phy-
sicians are”hopeful that the crest of
the wave of sickness has passed and
that the disease has spent its force
-It Is ‘generally agreed, that the "Flu"
{8 nothing more ar. léss than old time
“grippe” that has invaded the coun-
try intermittently since 1889, each
epidemic having its own peculiar
characteristics with fatal results. The
attack Is complicated with pneumonia,
which accounts for so many fatalities.
If the people remain calm and follow
the precautions laid down by the
Provincial Boards of Health, good re-
sults are bound to follow.
