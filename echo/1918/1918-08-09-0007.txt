W. Heaton, of Taronto, Provincial

Chief Constables’ Assoclation of On-

tarlo stood practically at the head of
the whole world in the matter of fire
losses. There were 10,000 fires last
year in Ontario, and the "fire loss per
capita” was $6, compared with 26c in
European countries.

There Is no doubt that a large pro-

due to carelessness and lack of fire

FREQUENT CLIPPING

CHANGE FORMULA
OF STANDARD FEED

   

 

Clipping wheat and oat ‘stubble, as
practiced at the Ohio Experiment Sta-
tion, prevents weeda from ripening
seed. and smothering out’ the young
clover and grasses. The stubble and
weeds soon rot on the ground and ure
not raked up with the following crop
of hay. More and better grass will
also result from clipping weedy pas-
tures. This should be done soon after
havest using a scythe where it 1s not
possible to use a mowing machine.
Briers and elders are. destroyed by
frequent cutting close to the ground.

The weeds: In alfalfa meadows may
be destroyed by Cultivating. with a
light disk or spring tooth harrow im-
mediately after removing a crop of
hay. Alfalfa’is deeply rooted and will

after it {a a year old.

HONESTLY OR SHAMMING?

The alleged prevalente of rheuma-

before Justice Latchford, M.S.A. tri-
bunal, at Osgoode Hall. . In fact, the
proportion was estimated at about

public representative, suggested to hi
lordship that medical testimony ought

In“order to meet difficulties that
haye arisen In connection with the

paration, will permit itibeing sold to
farmers at 1 price much Tess than that

though he fully comprehended his at-

against Paul's shoulder.

They became great friends, those
thrée. Then'a new token of Interest
came Into Paul Dacre's life. He naturs
nlly met Alma and they became quite
friendly. Head-strong, erratic, nc'er-
do-well as he was, there wus some-
thing beautiful in his love for Ned and
old Snowfoot. Paul did odd jobs in the
town, but every morning he was on
hand to help Ned get over his route.

As to Alma, he idolized her, and told
her so, “Some day I'll make a fortune,”
he declared. “I'll make you all rich
und you'll.have so mapy suitors you
can pick some prince or major general
for thé husband you deserve.»

And now Paul, homeward bound,
was surrounded by a erowd of juvenile
admirers. He pretended to whisper In
Snowfoot's  epr. Immediately the
clever animal he had tehloed In old-
time circus tricks started runhbing
around In a ving. * Paul described a
running jump, to land squarely upon

off on the tril of the man with the

It was the net morning when Paul
reached the cityand located the horse

heels of Snowfot. He found where
his favorite anl some twenty other
horses were houed In a pen, to be sold
at auction the nixt morning.

Paul had but me Idea, to make away

ropes and plagorms were suspended

workmen were suspended putting In

About the middle of the building
stood a vell-dressed, Important-looking
man, hoding his little four-year-old
daughter by the hand. He was giving
orders as © certaln construction ‘de-
talls «to th: contractors, and, Paul
learned msunlly, was head officer of
the costs exchange, a man of enormous
wealh who made a hobby of improved
live stock.

His restive little daughter, a bright,
lovely little midget, had taken ad-
vantage of her father's preoccupation
and had run about fifty feet td the

clambered up the stepa leading to the
