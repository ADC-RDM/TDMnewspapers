JOIN SPLIT SHIPS

U. S. Engineers announce Completion
of New Caisson.

Engineers of] the United States
Shipping Board, at Montreal, are com
pleting ‘a calssbn expected to permit |
of the rejoining of vessels, cul in half
to enable their passage through the
Welland Canal, ‘without putting the
vessel in drydock, The feat seemed
impossible when first suggested last
year, but the engineers havesproved
its feasibility by rejoining 12 halved
ships while they were afloat

Temporary frames of 6x6-inch angi=s
are placed around both sections of |
the ship at the point cat in such a way |
that they can be drawn close together |
when the ship is joined. There angles
are bored for two-inch fitted bolts. The
plates of the shell. tank top and deck |
whigh- do not but om” the
frames are taken off, and, where ne-
cessary, light patches ‘are put on to
support the angle frames. WI hen the
two sections of the ships are floated

ia] frames. Fitted bolts are then in-
gerted and the ships holds firmly to:
