JN MEMORIAM.

 

“None knew her but to love her;

None named her but to praise her.

God rest her beautiful soul.

Truly may the above words be ap-
$5,000 | plied to Mrs. Lambert Bertrand, whom
death claimed on the 14th ult. at her

home on Murray street.

Not as an avenger did the Great
Reaper come, but as an angel—an
angel of sorrow in truth to the living

ones, . who sorely mourn their great

loss, but an angel of peace and bliss
as vividly personated by the regretted
deceased. The friendly smiles so lav-
ishly bestowed on all who came in con-
tact with the lovable lady during her
life, lingered on her beautiful face as
she lay cold in death. To the hosts
of friends from far and near who came
to pay their tribute of respect, love
and sympathy death seemed like a
gentle sleep. How peaceful! How
beautiful!" were the oft" repeated
words uttered.

Mrs. Bertrand was a bright woman
and a leader in every charitable work
in behalf of her church. Alma Mater
in Philanthropy, the afflicted and the
needy found thelr way straight to her
heart. Charity in word and deed was
the keynote of the deceascd’s noble
character—the beacon light which led
her onward and upwards in the path
of life until the goal—Heaven, was
reached.

- In poor health for several years,
Mrs. Bertrand's wondrous vitality and
sunshining disposition effectively cor-
responded to the expert medical care
of Doctor Teeter when: that of many
clever physicians failed. On Sunday,
the 14th ult, only seven days after
the deceased had been confined to her
bed, medical skill could no longer
ward off the fatal blow, All that love
and money could give was profusedly.
bestowed ‘on the loved departed one,
by her-.fond husband, whose ‘grief is
most intense. Arrayed in a pale
) silk gown, - reposing in a
mahogany couch casket covered with
silk mauve velvet, surrounded by a
wealth of most beautiful flowers, the
mortal remains lay in stale until the
funeral, Spiritual bouquets, mass offer-
ingy were most nimerous. From fay and

near messages of sympathy poured in;
relatives and friends, rich and poor

paid their last tribute of esteem and
gratefulness. The funeral was one of
the largest held in St. John the’ Bap-
tist RC. church,

Among the distinguished persons in
attendance were Mother Martin of the

“Ascension, Provincial Superior of the

Sisters of the Holy Names In Ontario;
Sister M. Zenon, Superior of St. Jos
eph’'s Academy; Sister M. Celinfe, Su-
perior of St. Jaseph’s convent, Lols-
ellevilld, and Sister M. of Jesus, of St.
Mary's Academy, ‘Windsor. The
church services were more Ilke a
great Holy Dayfcelebration than a
requiem. Solemn mass was celebrated

.by Rev. Father V. I. Donnelly, Deacon

Rev. Father Ryan, and Sub-Deacon
Rev. Father Kennedy. The officiat-
Ing clergymen wore white and gold
vestments, the gltars decked, numer-
ous electric jets and candles shone
Hke stars—all {liustrated a triumphal
entry into heaven, not a burial in the
cold ground.
O death! where {8s thy victory?
=O grave! where is thy sting?
