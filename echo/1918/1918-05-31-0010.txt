the free land grants.

In the years 1779 and 1780 there was
a great rush of emigrants into the
“Lone Lands” of Kentucky, and am-
ong one of the groups we find the fam-
ilies of Munger and Tofflemire, also
the soldier, Leonard Kratz, who being
familiar with the country, acted as
guide to the party.

In the Munger family, was a daugh-
ter named Mary. It is not known
whether she and Leonard were ac-
quainted before leaving Virginia. but
somewhere on the journey it appears
that Leonard proposed to Mary and
was accepted. The next thing to be
done was (o obtain the consent of her
parents, which, to his surprise, was
most positively refused, their reason
being that he was a soldier. This was
a great disappointment to the lovers,
but it also made them more deter-
mined. They waited until they were
‘well on their way, when he brought
them to a halt by declaring he would
go on further as gulde unless they
would consent to his marriage with
their daughter. This was placing
them in an awkward position, for to
be left in the wilds without a guide!
could not be considered for a moment,
50 after due deliberation they consent-4

mony was performed.

of Cincinnati, where after a stockade
was built, which they called Ruddell's,
they began to prepare for planting the
next season.

In the following spring a campany
of 600 Indians and Capadians, and
several pieces of artillery, made a
raid into Kentucky. Simon Girty led
the Indans and the whole force was
under Captain Bird, an officer in the
British army. They travelled down
the Miami to the Ohio, thence to the
Licking, up it as far as the -Forks,

marched on to Ruddell's stockade,

As they decfled to go no frutler,
they, returned to the forks.of the Lick-
Ing. where they had left their hots.
Here the Indians, retaining their pris-
oners, separated from the rest of the
company and proceeded up the Miami
River, one group taking the male and
another the female prisoners.

With the women and childrén was
the wife of Leonard?Kratz: and her
new born.child. One evening as, the
young mdther was struggling up the
vank with her bapoy in Wer arms she
stumbled “and fell, striking Its head

sitting up against a tree with his ket-

of hunger but for a squaw who, while
the Indians were feasting on horse-
flush, secured the entrails, wifich-she

froit, wherd they were ransomed by
Gen. Macomb, who paid their price in
biankets. The sufferings endured by
thom on their march had rendered
theln unfit for work, so they were
cared for by the authorities until they
were able to look after themselves.

Leonard Kratz, not knowing where
his wife was, hoped that her capLors
would bring her to~Detroit, Every
day he would. go. to the dock, whers
the canoes arrived from the different
parts of the country, expecting that
some day' he would find her. At Ins
he was rewarded, for as he was about:
t turn to a boat, which had just ar
rived, he heard a voice cailing, “Loon.

wife. The hardships of the Journey
had so altered her appearance that lie
did not recognize her.

In 1781 Kratz, the Mungers and
TofMlemires, who were also taken
prisoners at Ruddell's, were settled on
Hog island, where they remained un.
til 1786, when Kratz moved to Tren.

the Mungers moved to Grosse 18h,

Colonel Bolton:

Sir—I have received your letters
of the 8th and 14th inst. informing me
of Joseph's success, and covering a
copy of a letter and extracts from
Major DePeyster and Capt. Bird.

In regard to settling prisoners from
Ohio at Detroit, it is so favorable to
my determined scheme for agricul
ture, much approved and strongly re-
commended from home, that it must
be encouraged but at the same time
1 should think It unsafe to permit so
many of them to remain together and
perhaps impolitic with respect to the
Indians who are naturally jealous and

suspneious, smd should any bad con- BR \J
sequence remit from settling those y
people on their lands, they will at- b
tribute it to design, | therefore wish
to bave them divided between De-
trolt, Niagarz and Carleton Island—
those who remain at Detroit to be set-
tied on Hog Island—at Niagara you
will dispose of as many as the situa-
tion will admit of, and send the rest
to Carleton Island, and as the season
will be too far advanced for them to
build after their arrival, you would
do well with the assistance of Col.
Butler, to choose proper situations,
and have log houses erected for them
by the Rangers, and whatever men
you may occasionally be able to spare
from the garrison.

‘Strange people are the Red Heads of

They also wear red knotted cords
