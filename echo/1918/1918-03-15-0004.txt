The . Dominion Government has
passed regulatfons governing packing

uses. Hereafter no packing house

th an annual turnover of $754,000 or
over can make more than? per cent
on annual sales, or more than 11 per
cent. on actual working capital. Regu-
lations governing packing companies,
effective from January 1st, 1918, were
issued Monday night. A dividend not
exceeding 7 per cent. on actually in-
vested capital goes free. A dividend
between 7 and 15 per cent pays one-
half over 7 per cent. to the treasury.
The regulations stipulate further that
“no person. association, firm or incor-
porated company shall engage in the
slaughter of live stock or the manufac-
ture of products therefor,” whose busi-
ness exceeds $750.000, gross sales,
without a written Ucense from the
Canada Food Board... Definitions of
profits ‘and the computation of capital
are dealt with at length in the regula-
tions. In computing capital {it {8 pro-
vided that the capital actually invested
in the busin 83 shall be the amount
paid up in cdsh of the capital stock.
Where the stock has been issued for
any consideration other than cash the
fair value of th» stock at the date of
issue shall be deemed to be the am-
ount paid up om such stock. In no
cage ‘will ‘the value of the stock’ be
fixed at am amount exceeding par
value. The actual unimpaired reserve,
rest or accrmulated profits of an in-
corporated company will be included
