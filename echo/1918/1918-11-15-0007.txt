do you think of the plan?

You are a farmer.

Canada is a farming country.

Canada grows more food than the
people of Canada need.

To prosper she must sell that sur-
plus food. :

Great Britain is our best customer
for grain, pork, beef, cheese and other
farm products.

Every practical man must see how
important it is to hold the British trade.

Canada wants not only the profit on
this trade, she wishes to create a good-
- will in Britain. towards Canadian pro-

ducts and thus assure our export busi-

ness for the future.
At the moment Great Britain asks
for credit, asks Canada to sell her the
roducts of the farm, “on time.” To
e<hold her trade, it ismccessary to give

this credit.

This takes capital—immense capital.
For Britain's purchases from Canada

are huge, and these purchases must be
paid for in cash. :

In these times, it is not easy even
for a nation as wealthy ‘as'Canada’ to
procure money. Certainly, no other
country can lend us money. The only
way now open for Canada to secure
- money is to berrow from the peaple of

Canada.

This is the reason for selling Victory

Can anyone deny the-sound business
sense of this plan of protecting our
valuable market?

From the standpoint of the man
who lends, what better security could
he oet for his money? Where else
could he get a five and a half per cent.
return on such security? Where would
he find an investment to pay interest
so regularly and with so little trouble
to the lender? Certainly Canadians
have an opportunity to benefit very
directly from this borrowing plan.

And the money Canada borrows is

spent entirely in Cahada—a very large

part of it for the very crops the farmer

has to sell. I
