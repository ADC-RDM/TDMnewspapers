ville, had been appointed to the va-
cancy in Windsor caused by the death
of ‘Police Magistrate Leggatt. Even
papers, usually sympathetic with Pro-
vincial Government action and apolo-
getie for even rank mistakes, angrily
characterize the moves made by Con-
servative politicians in connection
with “this appointment as “Political
camouflage.” There {8 no doubt that
Barrister W. A. Smith, of Kingsyille,
was. a logical successor to the late
P. M. Leggatt, and would have made
an Ideal “incumbent, but: in their ef-
forts to spoil his ahances Windsor
politicians even stuffed the Detroit
Press into believing that Mr. Smith
had declined the pasition owing to the
salary being insufficient, putting him
in a very Indelicate position. when
that phase of the question had never
been, mentioned, During war time,
wlien political jobery was supposed to
be “canned”, the various moves made
by Tory ward "heelers in Windsor:
showed very plainly that thelr pro-
testations of loyalty anl everything to
win the war were “camouflage” of the
rottenest kind. Just how any party.
had a cinch an the position at this’
time offpolitical truce (?) is difficult to
understand. Howewer, a quarrel be-
tween the big chiefs let common peo-
ple into secrets they suspected but
couldn't prove before, and that all ia

counsels. Mr, “Miers no doubt will
fill the position with much acceptance.
