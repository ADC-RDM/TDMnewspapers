AMHERSTBURG SOLDIER KILLED

Mrs. Harry Martin, of Oxley, re-
celved a cablegram Monday containing
the sad news that her son, Pte. Ray
| Martin, had been aceldentally killed
in France. No further details of the
| dire happening have since arrived.
Pte. Martid went overseas two years
ago with the 98th Battalion from Es.
| sex county, but was transferred to tho
{47th and had been In France for &ix
months. The ‘young man was born
{ln Amherstburg 21 years ago, where
his parents lived for some years, and
Is survived by his gorrow stricken
mother, two brothers, Percy, of Ges-
{to}; Ralph, of Oxley, and a sister, Fran.
|ces, of Oxley. This fs. thé second
dreadful blow Mrs, Martin received in
recent years, her-- husband, a well
{known marine chef, having been
|drownéd by the sinking of his boat in
| Lake Superior, and she {3s bowed down
with grief. ‘Mrs. Martin was formerly
{a Miss Balley daughter of*Mrs. John
| Bafley, Amherstburg. Capt. Roy
| Bailey, M. C., whose death in action
occurred two weeks ago, was her
nephew, To her,and all the sorrow-
