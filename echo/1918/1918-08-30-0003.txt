ARM help is scarce, but this condition can be relieved
to a marked degree by using machines that accomplish
more work in a given time with less man power.

Why should the farmer cling to horses—a slow, expensive
means of power—when every other business is adopting
the truck and thereby reducing the cost of hauling, speeding
up deliveries, and saving for human needs the food that
the horses would otherwise consume?

The motor driven truck‘ean work constantly at maximum
load under the burning summer sun, or in the coldest weather.
Unlike the horse it needs no rests while working, it eats only
while in actual use, and when the day’s work is done it

ures very little attention, and leaves you free for other
“Chores” about the place, Then, it can be housed in one-
quarter the space of the horses, wagon and harness it replaces.

It is a mistaken idea that a truck is useful only for driving
upon paved roads, The Ford can be driven all over the farm,
and used for hauling grain, potatoes, fruit, roots, fertilizer,
wood, stock, milk “or any other product. The speed it
travels, the time it saves, and its sb upkeep cost appeal
very strongly to all users of the Ford Truck. If you need
help, order your Ford Orie Ton Truck today.
