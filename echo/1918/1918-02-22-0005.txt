Following {tem from the Globe of
February 6th is Intéresting locally:—
“Eighty-five years ago the late Wm.
Roseburgh settled on the Rosebrugh
homestead near St. George. The day

before moving to the place Mr, Rose-’

brugh planted a seedling apple tree
there. On this tree grafts of Holland
Pippin, Malden's Blush and Snow were
afterwards placed. The tree, now
twelve feet in circumference, and with
on spread of forty feet, ia still alive,
and during its long life has continued
to bear three different varieties of fruit
in addition’ to the nondescript seed-
lings.”

The report of P. T. Clark and A. Ed-
ington, Auditors of the accounts of the
Municipality for the year ending the
31st of December, 1917, has been print-
ed in pamphlet)form, and shows that
the financial affairs of the township
were splendidly administered last
year. The total receipts were $62,914..
70, and the expenditures were such
that there was on hand at the ond of
the year a balance in the ‘Imperinl
Bank to the crédit of the township of
$16,784.68, The assets are $33,466.18,
and’ although the liabilities exceed the
assets by $463.90, had there been an al-
lowance made for the Cedar Creek
bridge the assets would exceed the
liabilities by $3,023.11, which would
have been better than the year before
by $937.30. The abstract statement
appears in_this issue of The Echo, and
the report in book form fs in the hands
of the Township Clerk and the Town-
ship Treasurer.
