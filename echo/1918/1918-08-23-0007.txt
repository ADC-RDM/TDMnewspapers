The men of the Merchant Marine have given loyal service

They deserve the utmost we can do for them!

relief of dependents—no separation allowance—no pension ?

In conversation with a weekly news-
paparman a few days ago the repre-
sentative of a Toronto firm expressed
the opinion that the day of the*town
merchant had returned if he . only
realized. it. He pointed out the cost
of doing business in the big cities had
mounted so high .during the past three
years that the departmental stores
could no longer, afford to five real
bargains any mor, but that the coun-
try merchant, whose costs have not
risen ip proportion, . could ypdersell
the big fellow on almost any ariel.
This seems to be a well-founded state-
ment, for a few weeks ago the wife
of a wage-earner In a nearby town
wanted to get a suit of clothes for her
little boy. She first visited the local
stores that sell that class of goods,
examined the quality and got prices,
She. saw an ad. of the departmental

FUTU RE OF GRAPE-GROWING.

 

Raisin Varieties to Take the Place
of Wine Grapes.

 

The right spirit is exhibited by the
growers of grapes heretofore used

determination to do no crying over
spilt milk in the event that the wine
industry- is adversely affected by
legislation. Alredy some of them are
gralting thelr vines tw meisin warieties.
Others no doubt will find some totally
different crop equally profitable. Staple
food crops are beginning to bring
returns to the grower far greaten than
they did a fewsyears ago. The pro-
ducts of the Jand are in demand and
it Is part of the business of farmers

ing times.

It will’ not be the first time that a
new and important in@ustry has been
built up on the‘foundation of an old
one. ‘The pitted plum boom in Oregon
is ‘one example. There was a tife
when enthusiasts thought that here
could rgt possibly be too many pitted
plums®in the world. A fickle public
thought otherwise, and the ppice fell
far below cost of production. Finally
there Was no market at any price,

them.

off and engaged to marry a beautiful
young lady. The man whose house we
visited tonight admired her, demanded
her hand In marriage. Her father was
an old ‘business associate. The other

possession of a document In that green

perhaps imprison Angeln's father. To
evade the same, broken heartedly she
turned me adrift, sacrificing herself to
save her father.”

“The father had gone wrong, eh?”
submitted Bill bluntly. 2

“Not In a criminal sense, In order
that a large but falling business might
be reorganized, he.took upon himself
the risk of an Irregularity. He saved
the business and no real wrong was
done. That was years ago. I learned
the truth from his lawyer, who has vis-

ment, saw it, noticed where he put It
in the safe. Now his fangs are drawn,

those I love.” St

handed the green envelope to Arthur
Ridgely.

ter, fairly trembling with emotion.
