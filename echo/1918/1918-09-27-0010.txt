THE BUSINESS WOMAN

To-day more than ever before, is
woman's opportunity. Many new LOC-
cupations are” now opened to Her
which, before the war, she was deem-
ed unfitted to fill. And the truth to
iell she has risen to the opportunity,
and now shares many business re
sponsibllities in former times confined
lo men. But, as women are subject to
more frequent fluctuations of health
than men, many will be handicapped
early, If they regard thelr health re-
quirements too lightly.

The nervous strain, long hours and
pro'onged. mental or physical fatigue
thin the blood and weaken the nesves
Such conditions as women are how
called upon to" undeigo can only be
endured by a full-blooded constitution.
This is true for men as for ‘woren.
only weaker women
The women worker, in any lime, re-
quires her blood replenished frequent:
ly. She needs new, rich blood to keep
ber health under the trying condi-
tiongs of business life, and to fortify
her system against the effects of over
work. This applies also to the wo-
man in the home, who perhaps, has
more worries and anxiety than usual.
So let all girls and women take heed
and renew their blood promptly at the
first appearance of pallor, lack of ap-
petite, headache or backache. This
can be best and most effectively ac-
complished by taking Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills which make new, rich blood
and thus help womankind so perfectly.
No woman need fear failure of health
If they take these pills occasionally
to keep them well, or give them a fair

find themselves run

You can get Dr. Willlams' Pink Pills
through any mediciné dealer or by
mail at 60 cents
for $2.50 from The Dr. t
