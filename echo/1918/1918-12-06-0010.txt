History tells us the origin of our
national maréh—the famous “Yankee
Doodle.” For more than 150 years it
has led us to victory. Few, perhaps,
remember that to an English wit and
musical genius we are indebted for the
old tune. But true it Is, although it
was composed in a spirit of ralllery,
awakened by the sight of the “Yankee
Doodles who came to town™ fn answer
to General Amherst’s appeal to the cole
onles for hid. »

It was in the summer of 1755, that
the British army was encamped on the
east bank of the Hudson, a little below
Albany.

They were to open a campaign against
the French Canadians, and the well-
disciplined - and uniformed troops
awaited the arrival of the volunteers.

In they came, a motley crowd, old
men, middle-oged men and young men,
but all with bruve hearts beating and
strong arms ready to do battle. Some
were mounted on ponies, others on old
farm horses, taken from the plow, and
many, with a zeal which knew no fa-
tigue, hurried in on foot.

Each carried his own outfit and pro-
visions. No two were dressed alike;
there were long coats and short coats,
and no coats at all; there were high
hats and low hats, covering closely
cropped heads, or wigs with ‘flowing

Shackburg, entertafned his friedds at

the volunteers.

Greatly to the amusement of the

British ofeers, the provincials recely-

Shackburg gravely assured them that
it wns a “celebrated alr of martinl
