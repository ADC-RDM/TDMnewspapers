clety would bring out just a few of

The stock sale at Mr. Pollard's on
Tuesday was not as well attended as
might be expected, due no doubt to
the extremely busy season. The pure
bred bull Pussy Hengerveld and two
fine Holstein cows were sold to Guy
Campbell, of Malden, whose herd will
greatly increase their efficiency by
| this addition. The stock which was
not sold by auction will be disposed
of by private sale. Mrs. McLean's
implements, etc, were-all sold.

On Tuesday T. R..Quick, local con-

rant to appear in police court to ans-
ser a charge of driving past a stand-

Snider has not beén out of the town-
ship with his car this summer, he is

In 4i8 report on the Tobacco Exper-
iméntal Stations in Canada, the Chief
of the Tobacco* Division has the fol
lowing Interesting note about the
Harrow Farm: “A considerable num-
ber of varieties of the Yellow Virginia
[type ware tried at Harrow. Up to the
present the Warne has proved itself
best adapted to the district, but, it |
may yet be found that, in a normal
season, some other variety, especial |
ly Il grown from Canadlan®seed, will'}
prove superior for special uses.” The
White Burleys grown in Ontario fall
{into two large classes—the Broad Leaf
|and the Stand-up Burley. Each of
|these cla¥ses comprises several varle-
ties. Although the’ Stand-up Burley,
on account of its earliness, ‘furnishes
a greater proportion of well-colored
leaves, most growers continue to pre-
fer the Broad Leaf on account of its
greater welght of crop.”
