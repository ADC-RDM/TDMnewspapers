ONTARIO

India, called ‘famine. *~
—Lord Rhondda,

Britain's Food Ceantroller. ~

One year ago, only the enemy was on

ratiens.

To-day, Greal Britain, France and Italy,

are on rations.

Today, Germamy controls the wheat
lands of Roumaria, Rmssia, Poland and

Ukrania.
To-day, fhe shadows of hunger, famine,
disease and death hang over the’ Allies.

Upon the 1918 erop from Canada and
the United States depends the fate of the
democratic peoples of the world.

That Battle-Line in France and
Flanders Must Not Want

 

Do you realize what a German Peace
would mean fo Canada?

Germany covets our natural resources

forests, our fisheries, , everything. that is
Canada’s.

The Kaiser would sacrifice millions of Ger-
mans to-morrow if he thought that by so doing
he could set foot on Canada’s shores as Con-

queror.

, And what's more, the Germans would offer
themselves for the sacrifice, so great is their sub-
jection to the military ideal.

The only thing that balks German ambition ~

is that battle line from the North Sea to Switzer-
land—and.the British Navy.

The Only Thing That Sustains Our
. Men on Land and Sea--Is Food

What are we, each one of us, prepared to do
to insure that Food supply?

Germany, by her submarine campaign, has
seen that great Armada, the British Mercantile
Marine, shrink in volume.

: Germany has seen South America, Austra-
lia, New Zealand, India and far away outposts
of the Empire practically cut off from supplying’
fod to the Motherland because of the lack of
ships. 1

 
      

~""_"Forty million Allied men and women having

been put on war work, food production has dan-

: gerously decreased in Europe.

‘These forty million consume more food than

when they were in ordinary occupations, and

there are fewer men for farming. ‘Hence an in-

creased demand and decreased supplies.

The harvest of France was one-third less in
1917 than 1916, and this year must be smaller
still, owing to lack of fertilizers, which cannot be
supplied through shortage of shipping.

must be of a common stock.

“In pre-war times, Britain, France, Italy and
Belgium yearly imported more than 750,000,-
000 bushels of grain, plus vast quantities of

meats ard fats.

“The submarine destruction of shipping has
made it necessary to abandon the hope of bring-
ing food from South America, Australasia and

India.

“Food must, therefore, be shipped from
Canada and the United States—the nearest and
safest’ route.

“Canadian and United States supplies are
normally 350,000,000 bushels short of the Ai-

lied needs. By greater production and conserva-
tion Canada and

the United States
must combine to
increase the ex-
port of grain by
150,000,000
bushels. ~-

The Canadian people must recognize that

Our Allies have the first claim on our food
supplies. ia =
As the shipping situation makes the Allies
dependent upon the North American continent
for food, it is vitally necessary that Canada
should increase her production of food in order
to take a larger part in providing for the Allies’
requirements. This is especially urgent as the
maintenance of a large United States army in
the European
field will cause a
very heavy drain
on that country’s
food resources.

it that it would in very truth be a million times
better for the people of these islands to be dead,
every one of them, rather than live on as the
serfs of a triumphant Prussia.” E5

How can any lover of liberty remain insen-
sible to this peril?

Food means Victory and the world made
safe for democracy—

Lack of food means disaster and subjugation
to Germany.

The Citizens of Ontario Must
Lead This Mighty Crusade
for Greater Food Production

They did it last year and will do it again.

As the greatest food-producing Province,
Ontario must maintain her leadership in Ameni-
ca. Great are our opportunities—our responsi- ’
bility is tremendous.

Upon every man and woman, boy and girl,
rests a personal obligation to serve. Every
pound of food produced, in whatever form, is a
contribution to the Cause of Freedom.

Ontario farmers should sow: 500,000 acres
of spring wheat.

* Every Ontario farmer whose land is at all
suitable should put an extra five acres into
pwheat, even at the expense of another crop.

What YOU Can Do to Help

At all costs production must be maintained.

That's why farmers and farmers’ sons are
being exempted from military service. Working
on a farm is equivalent to service in the Second
Line Trenches.

To enable the farmer to do the work two fac-
tors are essential. The first is Time. Whatever
we are to do must be done at once. Nature waits
for no man. The second is Labor. Many farmers
cannot plant the acres they would because they
cannot get the necessary help. Many are afraid
to increase their acreage because they fear they
would not be able to cultivate and harvest an un-
usual crop after they had raised-it. b

   
 
     

 

The burden is not one to be placed solely |

upon the farmer. Neither can it be placed upon
the townsman. If is a personal obligation upon
