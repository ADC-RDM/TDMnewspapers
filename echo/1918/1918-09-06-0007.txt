A SUGGESTION FORTHE FARMER

The following article from that well
edited paper the Picun Gazette con-
tains a suggestion that is just as valu-
(able to Essex county. .

“It the farmer of Pince Edward
could realize how mud pleasure it
j would give to many pple who are
spindid drives
through all ports of the county to have
some means of knowing whose homes
they arg passing, they surely vould
not be so careless about’ not having
their names plainly marked on their
rural mafl boxes. That some of them
appreciate this themsolves, was evi
denced by the fact thmt only a day or
two, ago one af Prince Edwards pro-
gressive farmers called at the Gazette
office: with the suggestion that a cam-
palgn be ingtituted to. induce every
farmer to have his name plainly print
ed on both sides of his mall box.

Needless to say this suggestion was
highly appreciated and was exactly
in line with what has' often been
thought of. It would mean only a few
minutes effort and would give great
pleasure to passersby if this sugges-
tion - was universally adopted. Prac-

 

 

has a mall box at his residence.. The
owner's name {8 not needed to {denti-
fy i as far as the mall carrier Is con-
cerned, but it would give great pleas-

very cheap and effectual way of adver-
tising that ought not to be neglected.

For the'benefit of those who are
anxious to follow out this suggestion

 

{{t might be stated that there is noth-

ing better that can be used for this
purpose than printer's ink. A very
ligtla bit of this commodity would
mark all the mafl boxes in a neighbor-
hood and a bbx stencilled with print-
er's ink will retain the name indefin-
itely.

COLD storage 18 a room
or building, depending upon
the size, cooled by ice or
by some mechanical means.
In short, it is a place for keeping food
products cool in the hot weather.
Since tho farms produce the food
and since the cooling of it should be
done quickly and immediately after
ita production, say milk for example,
in order to keep It in good condition
as long as possible, would it not seem
good business and economy to have
the cold storaga on the farm? This
applies to our farms particularly
since they produce such very per-
Ishable products as milk, butter,
eggs, fruit and meat. If there was

no other advantage In having cold
storage on the farm than that it pro-
vides a place fn which to keep the
dally victuals cool and sweet, there
would seem to be a good reason for
including it In the farm equipment.

There are many ways of providing
a small cold storage on the farm, but
with the exception of very large fruit
or dairy farms, the same principla
applies to all, namely, that fce fs
used as tho means of cooling. The |
method of applying the ice to the
best advantage constitutes the prob-
Jem in each individual case. This Js
why no one system can be recom-
mended for all cases. It Is my Intep-
tion to describe briefly below one
type which should give good service
in many farm homes.

The particular name of this sys-
tem ls the Bunker system. ‘It con-
6ists of a small room a few feet
square with a bunker or box or rack
at one side for holding the cakes of
fee. It Is separated from the room
by a partition which is kept a few
inches off the floor and likewise from
the ceiling. The bunker has a slat-
ted floor with pan just below to
catch water which Is disposed nf
readily through a draln. This ar-
rangement provides a natural means
for the cold alr to drop down to the
floor, escape into the cooling room
proper and for the warm air to pass
up over the partition to the ice, So
long as this bunker is kept supplied
with ice there will be a natural flow
of cold alr through the storage room.
If the room be well insulated Jt
should be possible to maintain a tem-
perature of about 40 deg. Fahrenheit
andafairly dryatmosphere. Those de-
siring plans for constructing the type
just outlined or any other type may
receive them free of charge by com-
municating with the writer. Inform-
ation and assistance will be frecly

ACH year brings a certain
amount of +rouble through
the feeding of new graln to
live stock, and In seasons like

tho present when food Is scarce and

the supply of old grain has been ex-

hausted before the freshly-threshed

grain Is ready there Is a likelihood
that more new grain than usual will
bo fed to the live stock and conso-
quently greater care should be exer-
cised to avold digestive derange-
ments,

The horse is generally considered

a little more susceptible to digestive
troubles following chitifes in fe
ing practice’ than are other clas
of farm live stock, It is always will
to make changes very gradually add
carefully. The main grain feed: of
tho horse In this country is oats, and
new oats should always be fed with
great care, Hard-worked horsea
should, if it Is at all possible, be fed
old oats and the new grain left: to
dry and cure for a few weeks after
threshing. At any rate (o avoid colle,
acute intiigestlon and Inflammation
| new oats should at first form only a
part of the grain ration, being mixed
with old oats and posaibly a little
bran and the percentage of the new
grain gradually increased until the
horses are on [full feed. Sudden
changes from old to new grain aro
especially dangerous with the horse
and particularly with the horse at
heavy work and on a heavy concen-
trate ration. There is, of course, a
difference due to the'time of thresh-
ing. Grain which remains in stack
or mow for several weeks and thus
becomes dry and cured is not so
dangerous as that threshed directly
from ‘the field or immedfittely after
harvesting,

As a rule heavy feeding of graln
is not practiced with cattle and sheep
on pasture. Where such {8 the case,
however, changing from old to new
grain should be done with care and
the substitution should be, it pos-
sible, gradual. If the ration must,
of necessity, be composed entirely of
newly-threshed grain ft should ‘at
first be comparatively light and In-
creased very gradually. .

Piga «usually handle newly-thresh-
ed grain" without much trouble, al-
though if on very heavy rations when
finishing for market “a little care
should be taken that they be not
thrown off their feed, Newly-thresh-
ed grain is difficult to grind fine and
is not enslly stored and large quan-
titles of the ground grain may dot
bo" stored In bulk as heating and
musting will result In lowering the

dering it unpalatable and less digest-
ible. Musty grain {s more dangerous
than clean, new. grain.—Prof. W.
