had landed up against the hard servi-
tude of -the logging camp. Once a
month he sent to the nearest post of-.
fice with the camp messenger his en-
tire salary, to be forwarded to the
loved ones at home. One day he eat
reading and rereading a letter he had
received from his wife. It seemed to
oppress him greatly.’

“Bad news,” Insinuated Edson In
sympathetic inquiry.

“Pretty bad,” ‘responded Walters.
“You see, our féw sticks of furniture
were mortgaged, and they are bringing
the. pressure of collection to. bear. I
can’t send enough to run the house and
release the debt.”

“Will that help?” asked Edson, hand-
Ing over his pay envelope.

“Yes, but—" ~

“Money is no use to me. I have no
home, no friends to send it to,” mur-
mured Edson in a broken volce. “You
are welcome to It, mate.”

“It will be repaid, believe me that!”
cried Walters, overcome with relief
ana joy.

One month later Edson Worth was
taken down with a two-weeks' spell of
féver. Walters nursed him constantly.
When Edson recovered, Walters in-
formed him that a relative of his wife
bad come to the rescue of the family
and bad decured an opening for work
for him back In his home city. v

“You will receive back that money
you so generously loaned me just as
soon as I get my bearings,” promised
Walters.

It was pretty lonesome for Edson
pfter this chance friend left him.
Then one day he made a discovery that
unsettled him greatly. On a strip of
paper lying under the bed he observed
penciled notations, his own name, that
of the station he had deserted and the
name of Marie Duntley. .

Edson tried to figure out the mean-
fog of this. The handwriting was that
of Walters. Suddealy his mind was
{llumined. In his fevered delirium he
had bared all the story of the pass,
and Walters had it fn mind to investi-
gate It when he returned to clviliza-
tion. No matter what kindly motive
might impel him, there was danger of

you know, there are no premiums with the Bigger Bar’s wrapper.
Here is a real ¢hance to save in housekeeping expenses.

COMFORT SOAP

If you really want more GOOD soap for

your money you'll just firmly ask your

grocer for the bigger Comfort Bar—he can

supply you. If you are still getting the

former, smaller Comfort Soap, keep

on saving the wrappers, they are still
for premiums.
