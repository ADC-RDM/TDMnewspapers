As an auxiliary to our present coal
supply, and owing tothe fact that our
chances of obtaining “Mard coal this
winter are, thus far, very slim, several
of us who own base burnérs and could
not use them last yoar-on account of
being without hard coal, will burn coal
oil gas in our heating stoves. The
heat from coal oll gas, it {s claimed,
Is greater than from coal or natural
gas, and it will prove a great boon to
those particularly whos® base burners
through force of advers8 and unavoid-
able circumstances were heatless last
winter. Fuel oll is legs costly than
lamp oll, and advantages for this sys-
tem over the other are claimed to bo
many. It has been tried out In other
places and ‘found highly satisfactory
and, no doubt, it will be specially op-
portune here, cut off as we aro from

A. regrettable state of affairs, due
largely to the fact that too Ifttle ad-
vertlising has been done'in the proper
chamnels, is now being gradually put
to rights and the outer world is
lewrning that there are great passi-
billitles here for market gardening and
Chtawba grape growing; As regards
thie latter, our geographical posifion
gives up the -advantige of longer
growing seasons, and the comparative
mildness (usually) of que winter sed-
son enables the Catawba grape to
thrive and mature as itiean do in.po

What Will You Do
For Help?

ARM help is searce,
to a marked degree by using machinés that accomplish
mare work in a given time with Jess man power.
Why should the farmer cling to horses—a slow, expensive -
means of power—when every other business is a opting
the truck and thereby reducing the cost. of hauling, speeding
up Jetiveries, and saving for human needs the food that
e

orses would otherwise consume?

The motor driven truck: can work constantly at maximum
load under the burning Summer sun, or in the coldest weather.
Unlike the horse it needs no rests while working, it eats only
while in actual use, and when the day's work is done it
requires very little attention, and leaves you free for other
“Chores” about the place, Then, it can be housed in one-
quarter the space of the horses, wagon and harness it replaces,

It is a mistaken idea that a truck is useful only for driving
upon paved roads. The Ford can be driven all over the farm,
and used for hauling grain, potatoes, fruit, roots, fertilizer,
wood; stock, milk or any other roduct. The speed it
travels, the time it ‘saves, and its low upkeep cost appeal
very strongly to all users of the Ford Truck. If you need
help, order your Ford One Ton/Truck today.
