that this town employ a competent

Reeve Brown—"This [8 something

thought that Mr. Dallyn might be able,
when talking matters over with the
council, to advise us as to what engin-

motion might better be deferred until
after our consultation with Mr. Dallyn.

Brown, but further argued in favor of
an independent engineer to get us fig-
