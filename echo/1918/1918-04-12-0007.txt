Premiums are not
: good value now

We've given them up—until after the war anyhow. There is
a far better way to give you value for your moncy and we've
done it—we've made the Comfort Soap bar much bigger.

New bigger Comfort bar is better value

Many of the Premiums—books, glassware; toys, jewelry, eto., used ta come from

Europe. These cannot be shipped now on account of the war, and the prem-
jums we can still get ate either 80 poorly mede or 20 expensive that the value simply isn't
there. The best way out is to give you all tho value of the premium in the biggest-selling
soap in Conado—that's Comfort. The Comfort bar is bigger now—at the same price.

Of course all wrappers, coupons, etc., now out in the
stores will be redeemed ao heretofore—but get them
in early while our Premium stock is still good. If
the new bar ion't in stock yet, the old one is just as
good value—with our present premiums,

“The Ford Saves the Hay and Oats
the Horses Eat

T HAS been estimated that five acres of land are required to mai
one horse for a year, and that the same five hi od maintain
nearly enough food for two Reople. If 650,000 Canadian farmers each
ord,

: replaced one horse with a
Nation
feed 100,000 people.

Just think what a great service this means to the coun

250,000 acres would be added to the

3s source of food supply and enough extra food made available to

try at the present

time ‘and the benefit to the farmers from the sale of food produced on

this acreage.

A Ford car also saves the farmer a week or more of valuable time each
year, which can be used for further productive work. The Ford travels
three times as fast as a horse and rig—costs less to run and keep, and is
far easier to take care of. With labor so scarce and high priced, time
means money, so do not delay in getting your Ford. :
