The average 100-acre farm in Ger-
many, at the -beginning.of the war,
prodyced as much meat as did the
average English farm of the same
size. The milk prbduction of thé
German farm was 50 per cent. higher
than that of the English tarm. The
amount of stock kept was about the
same, the English farm keeping more
sheep and the German farmer keeping
more pigs. The amount of manure
produced was no less. The grain’ pro-
duction of the. German farm WAS
nearly double that of the English
farm. Finally, 100. acres of tiliable
land In Germany supported 50 per

land, of approximately the same qual
