TOBACCO STAMP EXPLAINED.

Owing to misunderstanding on the
part of some of the tobacco growers
regarding, the sale of tobacco an in-
land revenug' officer thus explains the
use of the tobacco.stamp:

“The grower can sell tobacco four
ways, to the atorekeaper, to the pack-
er, to the manufacturer or. to the con-
sumer. - ’

“When he sells to the storekeeper,
packer or manufacturer he has to sell
In five pound lots or more and report
the sale, with amount. sold, name and
address of the purchaser, to the In-
land Revenue ‘€pllgetor. +

“In selling to the consumer he can
soll ‘one-quarter, onehalf or one
pound packages but he has to put a
five-cent stamp on every pound pack-
age or the equivalent stamp for the
smaller packago.

“Packers are mot permitted to buy

“| trom unlicensed growers nor sell to

the consumers. Therefore it {8 neces:
sary for the growers to take out
Heensen. immedintely.” ha
Noto—The following clause from
the Inland ue Act makes it clear
that the buyers for manufacturers
pay the flye cents per pound excise
duty of five (5) cents per standard
Jmanufacturers will pay the excise
duty of five (6) cent sper standard
pound on all Canadian leat taken for
use. The regulations governing trans-
