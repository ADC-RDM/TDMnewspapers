Please the Peopls—Familes Have
Old-Fashioned Visit.

The Union Pair at Amheriburg on
Monday and Tuesday drow the larg.
est crowd in its history. Thess smaller
shows are growing to be more and
more big family gatherings where
friends from far and near meet once
& year to renew acquaintance and
have a jolly time regardless of wheth-
or the exhibits are good, bad or in-
different. Fortunately the show of all
clagses of produce at Amhorstburg was
good though ft fell below what ought
to be 4 proper mirror of the possi-
bilities of this productive district.
Fruit this year wns the outstanding
feature, the exhibit of apples and
pears being the finest ever seen here.
Tho offerings were so many and var
led that he canned fruit had to be
banked on the center stand. P. L.
Fancher, of €hatham, who judged this
display. expressed great delight at the
carefulness evidenced In the selection
of the varfeties, and. the neatness of
arrangement. In the same part of the
bullding, Mra, Duers, of Goderich, and
H. J. Bell, of Walkerville, spent two
hours piacing the prizes on the butter
exhibits. The keenest competition
here was for A. J. Green's special
prizes of $26 for 25 Ibs. of butter. It
wis won as follows: 1st 10 Ibs. Mrs.
L: C. Brush; 2nd 10 Ibs, Mrs. Frank
18t & Ibs, Mrs. Ed. A. Mec
Gee. All these premier butter mak-
ers ‘are ‘from Malden, whose slogan
might with propriety be changed to
“Wheresthe best butter makers grow.”
Mrs. J. W. Noble, of Essex, assisted
by Mr. Bell, judged the canned fruit,
and found it excellent. Some excep-
tion was taken to opeming cans of
fruit to test the quality; and the
judges announced that this would not
be done .again at the , Fair. The
Ladles’ Work was very beautiful and
occupled ‘more space tk usual. Not-
withstanding the fagt that the show is
open to the world, and large quanti-
ties of work were brought in by Mrs.
Clark and Mrg.“Lec, of Kimgsville, our
own ladles figure largely in the dis-
tribution of ‘prizes, winniing most of
the prizes In, the different depart-
ments

The rest of the ground floor in the
building was taken up with pianos
and other musical instruments shown
by J¥J. Braul, Grinnell Bros. and

gorve the hearty thanks of the direc-
torate for their generous musical

board, slab slates, and electrical ap-
pllances, while opposite that Roy
Simone, the shoe rdpair man, fitted
up under an arch a well arranged dis-
play of shoes, showing them both

into the vegetable contest with a dis-
play of various vegetables, the pro-
duct of their own farm.

building with a neatly constructed and
attractive booth at which they showed
samples of thelr 'work for the soldiers,
took orders, and sold chances on a
