SAVE TIME.

In Pre-War times we put forth every effort and searched all the markets to buy staple lines as cheaply as possible. Manufac-

turers selling these commodities were barely- making an existence, and the same with thefr employees, To-day things have
changed. Prices have advanced, and all Operators, Machinists, Manufacturef® and Farmers are participating in the prosperity
that follows in the wake of WAR. We all know that high WAGES designate Prosperity, consequently we have searched all the

markets to secure the BEST VALUES, so that quality will remain long after the price is forgotten.
