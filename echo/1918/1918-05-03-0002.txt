\IN MEMORIAM.

“None knew her but to love her;
None named her but to praise her.
God rest her beautiful soul

Truly may the above words be ap-
plied to Mrs. Lambert Bertrand, whom
death claimed on the 14th uit. at her
home on Murray street.

Not as an avenger did the Great
Reaper come, but as an angel—an
angel of sorrow in truth to the living
oned, who sorely mourn their great
loss, but an angel of peace and bliss
as vividly personated by the regretted
deceased. The friendly smiles so lav:
ishly bestowed on all who came in con-
tact with the lovable lady during her
life, lingered on her beautiful face as
she lay cold in death. To the hosts
ot friends from far and near who came
to pay their tribute of respect, love
and sympathy death seemed like a
gentle sleep, How peaceful!. How
beautiful! were the oft" repeated
words uttered.

Mra. Bertrand was a bright woman
and a leader in every charitable work
in behalf of her chiirch. Alma Mater
in Philanthropy, the afflicted and the
needy found their way ctraight to her
heart. Charity In word and deed was
the keynote of the deceased's noble
character—the beacon light which led
her onward and upwards in the path
of life until the goal—Heaven, was
reached.

In poor health for several years,
Mrs. Bertrand's wondrous vitality and
sunshining disposition effectively cor-
responded to the expert medical care
of Pactor Teeter when that of many
clever physicians failed. On Sunday,
the 14th ult, only seven days after
the deceased had been confined to her
bed, ‘medical skill could no longer
ward off the fatal blow. All that love
and money could give was protusedly
bestowed on the loved departed one,
by “her.fond husband, whose ‘grief is
most intense, -Arrayed in a pale
mauve, silk gown, -reposing in a
mahogany couch casket covered with
4ilk mauve velvet, surrounded by a
wealth of most beautiful flowers, the
mortal. remalns lay in state until the
funeral. Spiritual bouquets, mass offer-
ingy were most. numerous. From far and
near messages of sympathy pbured in;
relatives and friends, rich and poor
paid their last tribute of esteem ‘and
pratefulness. ‘The funeral was one of
the largest held in St. John the Bap-
ust R. C. church.’

Among the distinguished persons in
attendince were Mather Martin of the
Ascension, Provincial Superior of the
Sisters of the Holy Names In Ontarfo;
Sister M. Zenon, Superjor of St. Jos-
oph's Academy; Sister M. Celinfe; Su.
perior of St.’'Joseph’s convent, Lols-
ellevilld, and Sister M. of Jesus, of St.)
Mary's Academy, ' Windsor. The
church services were more like a
great Holy Day celebration than a
requiem. Solemn mass was celebrate;
by Rev. Father V. 1. Donnelly, ‘Deacol
Rev. Father Ryan, and Sub-Deacon
Rev. Father Kennedy. The officiat-
Ing clergymen wore white and gold
vestments, the gltars decked, numer
ous electric jets and candles shone
like stars—all fllustrated a triumphal
entry into henvem, not a burial in the
cold ground:

O death! where {s thy victory?
O grave! where is thy sting?

P. Quellette,| organist of St.- Al
phonsus’ church, Windsor, and former
director of St. John Baptist's choir
here (of which Mra. Bertrand had
been many years.a member) sang in
his beautiful rich ‘voice several solos,
among which was an O Salutaris. A.
J. Burns rendered the .hymn “Thy
Will be Done” in a very touching man-
ner. * -

The funeral directors were the well
known and col tent W. S. Sutton,

of Windsor, and E. DeRosier, of De-
troit.
