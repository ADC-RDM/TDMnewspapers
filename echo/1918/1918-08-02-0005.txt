KE STOPPING THE CLOCK TO SAVE

In Pre-War times we put forth every effort and searched all hie markets to buy staple lines as cheaply as possible. Manufac-

turers selling these. commodities were barely making an existince, and the same with their employees. To-day things have
changed. Prices have advanced, and all Operators, Machinists, Manufacturers and Farmers are participating fm the prosperity
that follows in the wake of WAR. We all know that high WAGES designate Prosperity, consequently we have searched all the

i

markets to secure the BEST VALUES, go that quality will remain lorg after the price is forgotten.
