Two noted scientists, by experiments on
animals, bave proved that youthfulness de-
pends onthe thyroid gland.” And that some-
thing in oats seems to feed that gland.

It appears that qld age can be deferred
many years by caridg for this gland. The

Oats contain more energy food, more
food for the brain, more food {or the nerves,
than any other grain that grows. And nowit
seemsthat they also serve to kecpone young.

But common oatmenl isn't good enough
for such an important dict. THe rich,
plump grains alone are used in the Saki

Early fu the great. world war the
young painters in I'rance formed what
they called the Batailion de la Camous
flo, a battalion whose duties consist of
“making up” guns, nutos, shelters and
even whole landscapes to decetve the
enemy's eyes—the neroplanes. They
impart to a munition depot the inno-
cent appearance of a prairie. The 75's
under their hands take on tho sem-
blance of old {rees. Tree trunks and
old carts are transfigured by these
artists into ‘formidable « batteries on
which the hostile fire may spend itself,
They color the autos to resemble roads
or flelds.

The grand chile of the Camoufle is
the celebrated decorator Forain, who
earned Ais War cross at the front. Nor
is this work without its dangers. The
camoufleur must repeatedly ascend in
avions to judge the effect of his work
or to decide on ‘the necessary retouch.
ing to. be done, He must sometimes
advance ahead of the first lines during
the night to take measnrements which
will permit bim to imitate exactly a
certain tree trunk or a part of a crums
bled wall In No Man's Land. which
must be copied, molded. by clever
sculptors and armored the same night
to serve as shelters for observers.
