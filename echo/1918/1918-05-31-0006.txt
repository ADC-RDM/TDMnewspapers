Udder—Late Spring Suggestions
For the Farmer,

(Contributed by Ontario Department of
Agriculture, Toronto.)

HE arrival of spring brings
up the question, “When and
bow shall I set my bees out
of the Cellar?” to the minds

of all farmer beekeepers, The an-
swer calls for judgment on the part
of each beekeeper. The factors which
must take a part in forming correct
judgment are (1) the cellar, (2) the
bees, and (3) the season.

The ideal cellar will permit the
beekeeper to keep his bees confined
much longer than will an unfavorable
cellar, - This is desirable, A fairly
dry, dark, easily regulated and venti-
lated cellar when (hie temperature
can be maintained at 45 degrees
Fabr. Is ideal. Very few Obtario;
farm cellars will meet these require-
ments, bowever, so that the weather
conditions play a more prominent
part in the farmer-beckeeper’s decl-
slon. : »

As a ‘rule, the farmer-beekeeper

Watch the weather forecasts closely
and when the wind gets around to
the south and east, with a prospect
for rain on the morrow, start in the
evening and move ‘out all if possible.
Contract a'l entrances to suit size of
colony, giving strong colonies ap-
proximately 7% in. by 2n. and &r-
range a cushion “of chaff (6. to 8
inches thick at least) over the brood
chamber. It pays to pack the sides
as well, especially in tne northern
sections of Ontario. «Special packing
cases of 3 in. material are made for
this purpose, giving 3 to 4 Inches
packing room. The shock to brood
rearing is very much reduced @bLy
packing and colonies therefore build
up more rapidly.—W. A. Weir, On-

To ‘Treat Infiamed Udder'of Cows.

Local treatment consists in apply-

gives good results. ‘The fluid should
| ve drawn from cach quarter 4 or b
{times dally and after each milking
{ the udder should be well massaged

Where this oll cannot be readily ob-
tained its substitution by goose-

/ Plant the Cultivated Crops. }
To cnsure good crops’ of “carrots,
mangles, sugar beets, potatoes and

t pared and seed should be secured of
the highest quallty. Under average
conditions the Irish Cobbler variety
{ (carly potatoes) and the Green
Mountain (late potatoes) are recom-
mended for Ontario. ;To secure best
results with the, potato crop, it is
always better to plant them not later
than the 15th of May, This year
{ plant half your seed ten days earller
| than you have been accustomed to,
{and plant the other half at the
tusual time, The experiment will

of - early planting. If the potato
planter wnd sprayer have not already
been overhauled, a rainy day may
be very profitably employed In this

mating the thrift of live stock,

When pasture is provided for pigs

valuable this year.
