TBURG, ONTARIO, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 15,

FUEL-LESS.DAYS.

Fuel Controller Magrath's orders to
close practically all places of business
In Ontario and Quebee, Saturday, Sun-
day and Monduny last, were obeyed to
the letter throughout Essex county,
except where it was understood that
those using gus were exempt. Gro-
cery stores and meat markets were
open both doys until oon, and thy did
a good business during that time. The
desire of the people. to co-operate In

0. | the movement was shawn by them get-

ting their orders in early. Spring like
weather aided tho Fuel Controller in
conserving fuel and .also started a
rush. over the raflways that will likely
got a start hard to overcome. the rest
of the winter. Three cars of anthra-
cite have reached Amherstburg dur-
ing the past week, resulting {n the
local situation being relieved for. a
couple of weeks to come.

TRACTORS AT COST.

The Canedian Government has pur-
chased a thousand Ford tractors at
cost. They will be sold to Canadian
farmers at cost. Tho freight costa
have not vet been worked out, but it
is estimated that the average cost to
the former, including freight, will be
about eight hundred. dollars. In ad-
dition the Government has socured op-
tions on another thousand of the Ford
trectors:

The Ford tractor has not go far been
supplied. to any private individual.
The Ford factories are now engaged
on an order of some thousands of the
new tractors for the’ British Govern-
ment. Wien that order {5 completed
—probably by the end of March—de-
livery in Canada will begin.

Purchases were completed for Can-
ada after tests made of the tractor, by
Hon. C. A. Dunning, of Regina, and J.
D. MacGregor, of Winpipeg, ropresent-
ing the Minister of Agriculture. Both
Mr. Dunnfog and Mr! MacGregor ex-
press themselves as! fully satisflad
with the work of the tractor, and are
convinced of its practicdibility.

The tractor burns /either kerosene
or gasoline. It is designed as a two-
plough machine. “A fuel consumption
of 234 gallons of kerosene per acre is
regarded as a fair average. It is
claimed for the tractor that it_can|
plow an average of eight acres in ten
hours. The plowing speed Is given
as 2% miles per hour.

NATURAL GAS AND OTHER GAS.

The course pursued.by the Windsor
Record on the gas question has. been
a devious one, and has led it into a
corner which it cannot yet see. how
to retreat from. The Record has been
yelling itself hoerse for weoks ncross
the Province, in editorial and open
letter, calling*apon the powers at Ot-
tawa. of Toronto, or Both, to shut off
the gas from manufacturers and re-
serve it to keep the home fires burn-
ing. Ottawa went too slow to sult it,
Hon.” G. Howard  Férgnson, at Toron-
to, influenced by re] tations made
to him by dépuektions, fut through an
Act with such speed, giving the control
of the gas question into the hands of
the Provimeial Railway Board, that the
Record's editorial head swam, and jt
walkened Monday morning to: find. that
while the home fires were burning
sure enough, the Board -had- seriously
interfered with some of Windsor’s pet
manufactoriess by shutting off their
gas Bupply. Now the Record is trying

(to back pedal, and Is making 4 mess

of it. New light forces ft to the con-
clusion that while {t's a fine thing to
be warm, dead wheels mako no nolse,
apd the loss of mmnufactories 8 as |
serious no matter a8 a dinner made
late by low’ gas pressure, The Echo |
ventures to suggest that if the order |
from the Railway Board shut off gas
for fuel and manufactdring purposes |
from all other places but Windsor) the
Racord would have been suited down
to the ground. It is of interest to-note
how coldly the Racord received thoy
‘suggestion of -Mr. Proudfoot, Opposi-|
tion leader in ParMament, to fo glow
in, this matter and carefully consider
the effect such a swecping order
might have, and also to recall thé
double column of fulsome: flattery
poured upon Mr. Forguson hecause he
went slam bang through without any
consideration. On the dead now,
wasn't Mr. Proudfoot right?

FREEZING SILAGE.

“If a silo has on, good roof and the
windows, ventilators) and schute are

minimum was dencedly high' if he vis-

GAS USERS WANT MODIFICATION.

Deputations from cities in wentern
Ontario waited upon the Ontario Radl-
way and Municipal Board ot Toronto
Tuesday asking that the recent order-
In-council in connéction with the use
of gns be modified.

One deputation from Chatham and
Wallaceburg asked the Board for per-
mission to use in manufacturing the
Bas now used in heating manufactur-
Ing premises to prevent freezing. They
pointed out that thoy could use coal
for heating but could not conveniently
use It for power owing to the nature
of their equipment, The International
Harvester Company and other {ndus-
tries wore interested. ”

Later the position of certain small
Industries that depend upon gas was
placed before the" Board. Several small
plants turn out chopped feed for oat.
tle and the farmers depend upon this
sourco of supply. It fs now cut off
and farmers cannot get food for hogs
and other stock in sufficient quantities
An official of the Board Swill probably
be sent into the district to investigate
this phase of th# <ituation.

Windsor also 13 up Inthe air over
the closure, which affects 50 going
concerns there, and |s begging for
consideration.

A deputation headed by the mayor
Of Galt called upon the Board and as
a result of fepresentations made it
was stated that Galt was to be left

outside the scope of the shut down
order,
