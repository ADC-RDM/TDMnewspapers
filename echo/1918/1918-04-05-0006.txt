when the clement which appears fo be

failed, as the building was protected
by a cordon of soldiers, who easily re-
sisted the attacks, and. with the help
of mounted troops, broke up the mob's

The intentions of the mob leaders

HOW TO GROW POTATOES.

‘When three hundred and thiy.two
years ago Sir Walter Raleigh intro
duced the potato. from this continent
into Ireland, nobody could have fore
seen or imagined the immense part
that it, would come to play in feeding
the world. It was nearly eighty years
before the Royal Society of England
took up the cultivation of the potato
as a cheap food In case of famine, In
another eighty years famine in Scot-
land brought the potato into extensive
notice as a’cheap article of food. ‘An-
other: thirty years saw France taking
notice of its vadue. W. T. Macoun,
the Dominion Horticulturist, briefly
