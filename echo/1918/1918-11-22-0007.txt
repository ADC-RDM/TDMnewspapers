won't mind warming mine over.”

Myra, comfortably settled in the
enslest cheir of the sitting room, lazily
waved a slim white hand to her
mother's cheery good-by, a d’ turning
townrd the window watched the lively
little body cross the street and join
several other dear mother people on
the corner. Myra laughed scornfully.

“I'm surprised at mother; such a
motley crowd, tall, short, fat, lean,
rich and poor.”

Myra, however, falled to take note
of the one connecting link among the
women. Each one carried a huge sew-
{ng bag and everyone from old Mrs.
McCane's worn brown lining non-
strosity to .the wealthy Mrs. Van
Eaton's creation of satin and ridbon
wns overflowing with its burden of
brown and gray yarn and partially
finished garments for Uncle Sam's
soldier boys.

Myra yewned and turned lazily to
a hook fn her lap, but somehow she
could not get Interested. A coming
party was uppermost In her mind and
she was having rosy visions of her-
golf In the new satin gown which she
hod ordered just that morning. She
was wondering If she could get slippers
to match the delicate hue of her dress

her hair done by a halr dresser or trust
to her own nimble fingers to get just
the correct amount of wave into the
glossy strands of bronze. Pleasant
roveries were Interrupted by the In-
sistent pealjof the telephone bell.

Her eager greeting of her dearest
chum was cut short in horrified dis-
may.

“Cut out the party? Surely, you
must be mistaken, Dora—why I or
dered my dress today. On nccount of”
the war? My soul. This old war makes
me tired. I.don't see what this country
got Into it for, anyhow. | IT wish to

. . . What's that—make comfort
bage instead of dance? Well, of all
the nonsense. No, I won't! ‘help. It

* Myra returned to her easy chair,
pouting dreadfully. She caught up the

Her childish spite thus appeased, she
slumped down Into the Juxuriant
depths: of ‘the chair afid sulked herself
to sleep. 4

Her brother awakened her later by
flinging. the morning newspaper into
her Inp. Myra turned lazily to the
woman's pnge and rend ‘the fashion
talk first. Then she skimmed the love-
Jorn’ letters and read the next chapter
fo a thrilling serial of love and ad-
venture. That digested, she turned In
a bored fashion to the jokes,

One or two rather scandalous hend-
lines caught her eye, but as far as the
remainder of the paper was, concerned
it might jurt as well have been blank.

Her ‘brothep finally’ turned wistful
eyes toward the feminine heap In. the

She paused reminigcently, and then,
as If some sudden understanding had
taken possession of her, her eyes wid-
ened and a new light came Into thelr
dark depths.

“Oh Rob, I never thought about it in

Sobbing, she turned shamed eyes to
her brother, and he, hoylshly caught
her against his shoulder and patted her
tausled head comfortingly. After she
band quieted down a bit he arranged
the chair pillows about her in a some-
what embarrassed fashion, nnd then
stood before her eager eyes, asking the
question whieh his parted lips were
shyly refusing to do.

Myra sensed the situation Immedi-
ately, ns she looked up Into, his face,
She sighed a bit wogfully, but there
was real bravery in her voice as she
sald wistfully:

+I know what you are aching to ask,
Tob, seeing that I have been the ob-
joctor until now.” 4 =

«Until now—does that mean that
you consent, Sia?"

She nodded, though jt cost her a.
brave effort,

uyes, I conldn't say otherwise now,
Rob. Uncle Sam needs cvery. young
man. and—and Bert's place in the
ranks Is empty.”

“Thank you, Sls, he does need us,
every one, nnd ve wanted so much to
answer the call. 1 knoy mother'll be
glad.”

An hour Inter, when Mrs. Crane en-
tered the house, smiling happily with
the thought of a morning well spent, a
distinct odor of scorched potatoes
erept up her nose. Hurrying Into the
kitchen through the sitting room, a
surprising sight met her eyes.

Molly, , supremely unconsclous of
hurnt potatoes, wus busily superintend-
ing the cutting out of a big red cross,
while Myra's untrained fingers were
clumsily following {nstructions. Jhe*
boy. whisthng happily. wag gathering
np the remains of tnn silk, from svhich
fhe diuinty sewing bag, hanging across
the chnir arm, had been cut.

At a glance the mother knew that
something unusunl had happened, and
burnt petatoes ard everything else
were forgotten until, she heard the
story of the casualty list and how it
had awakened the heart of her dnugh-
ter at last, ¥

With her arms about her daughter,

the mothot’s eyes looked over the
bronze tresses and smiled bravely,

prondly at her son, who was goon to
be one of Uncle Sam's soldier boys.
