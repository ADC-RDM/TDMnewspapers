In the Dass :
of Duelliry :

Pr rm nll Gr AS
T an election fr Queen's
County, between Gen. Walsh
and Mr. Wariurton, of

| Garryhineh, abou’ the year

1788, took place the nost curious

{duel of any which hwe occurred

 

\ jrihin my recollection. A Mr, Frank
|Shelton, a boisterous, joking, fat
{young fellow, was prevailed on,

{much against his grain to challenge
/the exciseman of the ‘Own for run-
|ning the butt-end of a horsewhip
|down his throat the night before,
whilst he "lay drunk and sleeping
with his mouth open

Frank, though »¢ had been nearly
choked, was very reluctant to fight;
he said “he was sure to die if he did,
as the exciseman would snuff a candle

with his pistol ball! and as he him-
self was as big ad a hundred dozen
of candles, what chance could he
have?” We told him jocosely to give
the exciseman no time \o alm at him,
by whlch means he might perhaps hit
his adversary first, and thus survive
the contest. He seemed somewhat
antouraged and consoled by the hint,
and most strictly did he adhere to it.

Hundreds of the townspeople went
to see the fight on the greens of
Maryborough. The ground was Tégu-

o larly measured, gui the feends ut

each party pitched a ragged tent on
the green, where whisky and salt
beef were consumed in abundance,
Skelton having taken his ground, and
at the same time two heavy drams
from a bottle his foster-brother had
brought, appeared quite stout until
he saw the balls entering the mouths
of, the exciseman’'s pistols, which
shone as bright as silver, and were
nearly as long as fusils. This vision
made a palpable alteration In Skel-
*ton's sentiments; he chenged color,
and looked about him as if he wanted
some assistance: However, their ses
conds, who wepe of the same rank
and desceiption, handed to each party
his case of pistols, and half-bellowed
to them: “Blaze gdway, boys!"

Skelton now recollected’ his fn-
structions. and lost no time; he cock-
"ed both’ his pistols at once, and as
the exciseman: was deliberately and
most scientifically coming to his
“dead level,” afl he called it, Skelton
let fly.

“Holloa!"” sald tho exclseman,
dropping his level, “I'm battered, by
Jasusa!”

“The devil's cure to you!" sald
Skelton, instantly. firing his second
pistol.

One of the exciseman’s legs then
gave way, and down he came on his
knee, exclaiming ‘“‘Holloa! holla! you
bloodthirsty villain! do you want to
take my life?” N

“Why, to be sure I do!" said Skel-
“ton. "Ha! ha! have I stiffened you,
my Iad?” Wisely judging, however,
that if he stayed till the exciseman
|recovered his legs, he might have a
couple of shots to stand, he wheeled
about, took to his Heels, and got away
|as fast as possible.
| Jemmy Moft, his own second, fol-
lowed, overtook, tripped up his heels,
and, cursing him for a disgraceful
rascal, asked, “Why he ran away
from the exciseman?”

“Ough, thunther!” said. Skelton,
with his chasest brogue, “how many
holes did the villain want to haye
{drilled into his carcass? Would you
have me stop to make a riddle of
him, Jemmy?"

The second [nsistéd that Skelton
should return to the field to be shot
at. He resisted, aMirming that he had
dong all that honor required. ~The
second called him “a coward!"

“By my sowl," returned he, “my
{dear Jemmy Moffit, may be so! You
call me a coward, {ff you please; but
I did it all for the best.”
| “The best! you blackguard?” {

* “Yes,” sald&Frank; “sure, It's bot-
ter to be a coward tham a corpse!
and I must have been either one or
t'other of them."

However, he yas dragged up to
ground by His second; after
agreeing to fight agaia if he had an-
other pistol given*liim. But, luckily
for Frank, the las bullet had stuck
80 fast between the bones of the ex-
clseman’s leg that lis could not stand.
The friends of the jatter then pro-
posed to strap him to a tree that he
might then be able to shoot Skelton;

but this being positively objected to
by Frank, the exciseman was carrica
home.—From Sir Jonah Barrington's
Recollections.

WATER SUPPLIES FOR TOWNS AND CITIES.

SAFE WATER SUPPLY for a town or city: may be secured from
artesian wells, springs, lakes, or streams, provided that certain’
well-defined rules regarding tbe source of supply are followed.
Artesian Wells usually give a safe supply unless the well 18 sunk

{n fissured rock which may provide a cnannel liable to carry pollution to
(he well. If the well ia sunk through clay, sand, or gravel, as {s commonly

the case in this country, the water will'as a rule be of good quality, . Any
chance of contamination should be guarded against
ARTESIAN WELLS by having the s{des of thé pipe for. say four or five

feet from the top encased In concrete, the“ top
securely closed against outside impuritiés and the sections of the pipe

{tself screwed together, &
. L . .

Unless the aren whence a spring drains is protected against surface:
pollution the’tpring is not a very safe source of supply. In addition to the
general chances of pollution from thessurface, the outflow of the spring
should’ be protected against-surfaco wash. At Niagara-on-the-Lake there
! ore some very good springs In the embankment along the

WEALTH IN FISH OFFAL.

Average Trawler Could’ Enfir © Large
Amount.

The Empire Resources Develop-
ment Committee, who are advocating
state development of the fisheries of,
the Empire on terms that, would
bring fo the national exchequer a

ohara af thagirocgeds, aye prepared

a memorandum showing the prafits
that may be made from a more earc-
ful conservation of fish affal. A steam
trawler working in Icelandic waters
frequently takes, on a three weeks’
voyage, from 70 to 90 tons of had-
dock, cod, plaice, conlflsh, and the
like. The offal taken therefrom
would amount to from 46 to 50 bar-
rels of llvers alone, each barrel
weighing from five to six cwt. Under
présent arrangements these are the
property of the crew, and are known
as stocker bait. The normal price
fetched is 12s“per barrel; now from
208 to 258. The latest developments
include the splitting and curing of
he fish at sea, during a voyage
sometimes extending to eight weeks,
The livers ape. separated and melted
to oll; all heads, bones and offal are
made into manure; éven the skins
have a commercial value, and not a
particle of the catch Is wasted, The
amount of oil and manure landed
from one trawleg {8 from 500 to 1,000
gallobs of the former, and from 10
to 20 tons of the latter, while the
amount of salt fish landed Is between
150 and 250 tons. Tho {ish now
fetches from £30 to £456 per ton,
against £18 to £26 In normal thmes.

and a large plant erected for experi-
menting In the conversion of fish

A Famous Scholar.

In the days when the author of
“Alice” was engaged with somo. of
the great scholars in Oxford In in-
venting a sham chargo of plaga
against himself, a German orig
of the Jabberwock was suddenly dis-
covered, as well as renderings Into
Greck and Latin. Tho cofiort wos
mado to get Dean Scott to do tho
Gyeek translation, ‘and “Lewis
roll” wrote to “My Dear Dean,’ =
ing him to undertake it. Scott, of
course, was one of the world's Ereat-
est Greek scholars, the chief partner
in the production-of the tamons.Jexl-
con, vemarks tho Christlan Science
Monitor. Porson, indced, has-been
described (ds “a mero person’ com-
pared to him, and Johnson as having
no claim to the title of tho “Great

him that Mr: Godley referred, in
some well known lines about anather

“He knew all that was to be, known,

There was anothar great literary
co-partnership of the Liddell and
Scott day, in that of.Conybearo ond
Howson, the authors’ of the classic
Life of St. Paul. If Mr. Godley
thought that Scott knew more about
Greek than Liddell, a” great Oxford
character, Mark Pattison, the rector
of Lincoln; was sure that Dean How-
son knew more about St. Paul than
Mr. Conybeare. Mr. Conybeare had
been preaching in the chapel In Lin®
coln. ‘After the services -Pattison,
strolling back yhrough the quad-
rangles to his house, was overtaken
by one of the fellows, who asked him
what he had been thinking of so pro-

known to the whole university, “what

R. L. S. Liko Dickens.

Apropos of Dickens, there Is a cur-
{ous passage Lon the “Memories of
Vallima,” by Isobel Strong, bringing
C. D. and R. L, S. into quaint con-
junction: ‘I have been reading a

A CHAPLAIN DECORATED.

 

Elderly English Clergyman Who
Was Awarded tho V. C.

An English clergyman, over fifty,
wire already holds the D.S.0. and
M.C., has now. won the Victoria
Cross,

The Rev. Theodore Buyley Hardy,
Army Chaplaias’ Dopartment, attach-

od to tho Lincolnshire Reximent, ‘s
the sccond cdergyman to win the
highest award for bravery during the
present war, and the third since the
V. C. was Mhstituted. The London
Gazette, announeing the award “for
most eonspiceous braveryrand dovo-
tion to duty on many. occasions,”
says of. him:

“Although over fifty years of age,
he has, by his fearlessness, dévotion
to men of his battalion, and quiet,
unobtrusive manner, won the respect

nd admiration of the whoo division.

warvellous energy and endur-

ance would be remarkable even in a
very much younger man."

Several incidents exemplifying his
valor and devotion are quoted. An
Infantry patrol had gone out to at-
tack an enemy post in the ruins of a
village. The Rev. Hardy followed the
patrol, and about four hundred yarda
beyond our front line of posts found
an officer of the patrol dangerously
wounded. He remained with the
officer until he was able to get nssist-
ance to bring him in. There was a
great deal of firing, and an enemy
patrol actually penetrated between
the spot at which the officer was ly-
ing and our front line and captured
three of our men,

On, another ogeasion he worked
under shell and trench mortar fire,
digging out men buried by a ‘shell.
Once when our infantry had with-
drawn from a wood, and it was be-
lieved there wos no ome left, Chap-
lain Hardy came out of it, and on
reaching an advanced post, asked for
help to gét in a wounded man.

Accompanied by a sergeant, he
made his way to the spot where the
man lay, within ten yards of. a pill-
box which had been captured‘in the
morning, but was subsequently Te-
captured and occupied by the encmy
