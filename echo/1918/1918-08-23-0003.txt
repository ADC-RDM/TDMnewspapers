history begins with the reign of Jim-
mu Tenno, whose memory Is revered
today by all the sons of Nippon.

Jimmu the Great forced the savage
tribes to accept civil Institutions and
extended his beneficent Sway over the
mad | entire country. He established his
capital at Kioto. He formulated a code
of laws, established courts, encouraged
Industry, and laid the foundation tor

Ing’ foolish questions, gud told the fol-
lowing story:

One day a city man happened In a
country community; and while ram-
bling around he run across a depres-
slon In thg earth covering several
acres. Some perplexed, he questioned
a native close by, and was told that
it was the bed of a lost luke,

“You don't realy mean It?” returned
er | the. city man, “Whatever became ‘of
of | all the wilter?” a
“It was this way,” readlly explained
to | the native. “There was a plenle out
here last August, and when night came
on they had nearly a barrel of pretzels
left, which they didn't want to enrt
re | back home, 80 they threw them In the
to | Inke.) i - }

“Yes, I see,” luterjected the other as | *
the native paused, “but what had that
