tried them. Afler faking a few
boxes, I am now endively well. Yeu
have my permission to publish this
letter, as I hope it will persuade
other sufferers from Dyspepsia to
take ‘Fruit-a-tives’ and get well”;

in the world made from fruit.

one year ago, fearing death at the
hands of the unspeakable Turk. Sat-
urday her body was found in an aban-
doned shed in the rear of 89 Gould

—"“Twenty thousand meters have
been installed by the water board dur-
ing the last seven months of the pres.
ent fiscal year and the rate of instal-
lation will bo continued until meters
have been Installed in every bullding.
The object 18 to cut down on the con-
sumption of water, to make it cheaper
far the consumer and” not to tax the
capacity of the supplying facilities,
The report of the fiscal year ending
June 30th, 1917, just published, shows
18,651 meters installed, which record
has already been broken this year. It
{8 belleved the rapldly increasing num-
ber of meters will have an appreciable
effect {n the next few years in reduc-
ing the per capita consumption, which
is now 1656 gallons per day. During
the Inst gold spell in January as high
as 214,000,000 gallons of water were
used in a day by allowing water to
run to prevent pipes frou freezing.
Metered service would have prevented
a considerable part of this waste.”—
