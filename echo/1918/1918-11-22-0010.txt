the troops securd from Russia in
an effort to knok Italy out of the
war. For a week it looked as
though the story of Roumania and
Serbia would be repeated, but the
crisin passed, and Italy more than
retrieved herself in the two great
battles of the Piave, fought {n June
and October of tle present year.
Germany found fewod for exultation
in the failure of the Gallipoli cam-
paign gnd the defeat of the British
at Knt-el-Amara. The Allies met
with these disasters at the hands of
the Turks, but (he British, with
characteristic persistence, went at it
again, and the brilliant victories in
Mesopotamia resulted in the collapse
of Turkey. It wag in the cast that
the first signs came, about two
months ago, that the Central Powers
were going down to Ignominions and
humiliating defeat. .

It is possible now to look over the
war and to place our‘fingers on the
black periods of depression, but jt
Is also easy to follow the golden line
that led to the final victory of the
Allies. The ultimate good of civiliza-
tion made it necessary thot the En-
tente should win, It was a struggle
between reaction and progress, and
the purpose that one can trace in
history made thoughtful men feo)
that it was impossible for reaction
to triumph in the long run. The
Prussian war lords made complete
plans to conquer the world. and

nes it did not seem possibbe that
hey would fail, but they reckoned
withéut the eternal purpose In his-
tory. As Hilliare Belloc said of the
first Battle of the Marne. The Ger-
mans had made every calculation
that the human brain could devises
to make certain of victory, but “It
was not.do be,”

The effect of the Great War on
Ganede @ees already maa itself aps
parent. Our Dominidn entered the
conflict as soon as the Germans threw
down the challenge of Lattle,, Canada

ay be proud, chiefly because her
record Is the record of the Canadian
people. They rose to the call, and
gave of their money and their young
life in the cause of civilization. To
our armies histosy will give the cre-
dit of several of the most vital vie-
tories on the Western front” History
will doubtless also shy of the Dom-
Inion that the great mass of Cani-
dian citizens pruved true to their
loftiest ideals of devotion and self-
sacrifice. If we did not have the In-
spiring leadership thatrguided some
people, lke the Greeks, almost un-
willingly to do their duty, that fact
makes the achievement of the Cana-
dian people all the nore natable.
History will say that in this struggle
our young nation found its soul.
