Tn Pre-War times we put forth every effort ard searched all the markets to buy staple lines as cheaply as possible. Manufac-

 
 

urers selling these commodities were barely nmking an existence, and the same with their employees. To-day things have
changed. Prices have advanced, and all Operators, -Maduinists, Manufacturers and Farmers are participating In the prosperity
that follows in the wake of WAR. We all know that high WAGES designate Prosperity, consequently we have .searched all the
markets to secure the BEST VALUES, so that quality will remain long after the price is forgotten. :
