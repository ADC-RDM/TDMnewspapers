on the scales below the chute ready
to receive it. To facilitate emptying

the grain, the floor of the bins should
be sloping.

The important consideration in the
construction of granaries and bins

\ 4 for loose grain is to be sure that the

structure Is designed with sufficient
strength to prevent bulging of the
sides and springing of the floor, for
grain, owing to Its emormo out-
ward thrust, correspondia some-
wkat to that of water, has a ten-
{ dency to burst thé sides unless well
| braced or supported. Timber con-
| struction‘requires frequent repairs to
prevent decay and general deprecia-

may be empty, and when the

consigerable logs to the farmer, to
he consumer ,and to the nation.
Thousands of bushels of grain are, in §
| this way, annually lost to the pro-
ducers through sheer indifference to
the condition of the granary, Yet
this preventable waste may be easily
remedied and made gecure by lining
the bins with sheet metal. |

enough to. keep the udder soft the
day after-the lambs have been wean-

again milked out, Some ewes do

junction with the method outlined |230,,
above the ewes should be separated | 242 J

a good deal of the success of the | 276,
subsequent lamb crop will depend
upon the treatment the ewes receive
from time of weaning until after they
are bred. They should have good
pastures and be given an opportunity
of’ putting ron flesh. This Ils what 1s
commonly called “flushing.” Nothing
is better for this purpose than rape
pesture. It is usually from six weeks
(0 two months from date of sowing
that rape is rcady for pasture, If
