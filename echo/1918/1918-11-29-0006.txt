Twelve miles up Dufferin street from the City of Toronto, on the banks
of the circuitous Den River is 2 pretty stretch of broken land, . comprising
:zome fifty acres, is (be site of the Connaught Laboratories which
are destined to be a bright spot in the future
public health history of this fair Province. As soon as
the bpildings, now in course of construction, are ecom-
rleted all the various serums in use at the present time

in the prevention of disease will'be manufactured here. The rolling pas-

tures will accommodate the horses necessary for the blood serum used in

the preparation of diphtheria and tetanus antitoxins and of anti-meningitis

serum. H:re, too, will be prepared smallpox vaccine and Pasteur preven-

tive treatment of rabies. The land and buildings necessary for this pur-

pose are a gift from Colonel Albert Gooderhdim to the Provincial Univers
| sity, which makes and supplies these products for the Provineial Board of
Health, and which are in turn supplied by the Board free of cost to the.
people of the Province. Np better work is being done for the public any-
where in the civilized world, and the Board is much gratified by the
numercus letters and words of appreciation of this eferprise which come ;
from the medica! profession and the people! of Ontario. The generous gift
of Colonel Gooderham, it is hoped, will be but the beginning of a series of
similar gifts to public health work in Ontario, which can only be suceess-
fully carried out by money, which affer all judiciously used is the ehief
factor in the prevention of disease. \
