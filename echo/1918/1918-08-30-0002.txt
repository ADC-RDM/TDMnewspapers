TEACH PATRIOTISM
THROUGH HISTORY

Hon. Dr. Cody, Ontario Minister of
Education, has made the following an-
nouncements In . reference to next
year's examinations:

“The reinstatement of British and
Canadfan history as one of the sub-
jects in the Junior High School En-
trance gxamination for 1919 is a mal-
ter of {mportance to the teachers and
the schools. The department has made
arrangements which, it Is belleved,
| will stimulate and direct the study of
history In the schools. The value of
the subject in promoting patriotism in
providing material for a clear grasp
of Canadian civics and In expounding
Canada’s imperial relations and her |
place In the empire 1s generally re-
cognized. A circular will shortly he
jssued, which will’ contain a definite
outline of the course, both in British
and Canadian history.”

In the introduction ito the circular
will be found a belel and instructive
exposition of the method of teaching.
liistory. : x

“The course |b grammar for the
fourth form of the Public and Separ-
ate schools has been lightened and
amended by omitting parsing and
the paper set in the subject for the
High school Entrance examination
will emphasize the composition of the |
principles of correct spesch.”
