Little they cared as they filed from the Barrack Room,
Shoulder to shoulder, if need be, to die,
Was there one flinched? Not a boy, not a hoy of them;
Straight on they marched td the dread battle’s brunt—
Fill up vour glasses and drink to them, all of them,
Canada’s call found them all at the front.
