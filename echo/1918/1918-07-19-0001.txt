BASEBALL.

 

Brunner, Mond teams have not been
maintaining a regular schedule by
redpons of rain and. working over-
time, but several {important games
have beén pulled off. On Wednesday,
July 8th, the Engineers’ fast team de-
feated the Machinists 10 to 9. The
Machiniete tagged along behind from
thie start, but tied the score their half
of the 7th when they started a great
batting rally, getting in five- runs.
Buck Morin made a dandy catch off
Hanna's hot liner with two on bases
and two out. Capt. Tyler opened the
Engineer's half of the 7th with a sin-
gle to right fleld, stole second and
third base and walked home with the
winning runvon a passed ball. The
winning of this game tied the Engin-
eers and Machinists for first place,
and the standing to date is as follows:

{Engineers ,....:...... 3 3—626
| Machinists ........... 6 3—620
Riveters 34 2

  

On July 12th the game between the
Engineers and Riveters was postpon-
ed on account of rain. On ‘April 16th |
the Riveters and Machinists played a
tie game, 10 to 10. On July 18th, the |
Engineers—Riveters game was post-
poned, all working overtime, From
present appearances the Engineers
are going to cop the pennant, and that
