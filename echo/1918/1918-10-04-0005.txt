partment of the National Service

burg county, N. S., valued at $264,000,

with a good catch of fish on-board,
also fell a prey to the Hun ralders

burg fleet during August was only

PERTINENT QUERIES =

ON ASSESSMENT

Bureau of Municipal Research Issues
Bulletin on‘ the Subject.

The Ontario Asscssment Act - and
the way it Is applied in the differant
muncipalities is the subject of a time=
ly bulletin by tie Bureau 6f Municipal
Research. In amending the Asfess-
ment Act, the Committee ‘of the Leg-
{slature which was appointed last ses-
slon will doubtless consider the man:
ner in which the present act {s ap-
plied in different cities.

The law states that land shall be
assessed at its actual value, and
buildings at the difforence between
the selling value of the whole prop-
erty and the selling value of the land
minus the buildings.

The Act is applied, according to the
bulletin, on improved and unimproved
tnd in » number of different ways
and combinations of different ways
that are not only confusing but ex-
tremely inequitable when the. Pro-
vinelal war tax ds applied. u

In conclusion, the burcau propounds
tho following questions:

What {8s the meaning.of “selling
value”? ~ §

What {¢-the “actual value” of land
and buildings?

‘Why should one municipality con-
tribute more in proportion to the
Provincial War Fund than another?

Why should ono citizen. contributg
more in proportion to city or Pro-
vineial funda than another?

Wonld' a" Provincial Bureau of
Equallzation help solve the diffjeulty?

HARLES DICKENS is one of the world’s great teachers.
Here is what he has to say in one of his books:

“My other piece of advice, Copperfield,” eaid Mr.

Micawber, “you know.

Annual income £20, annual

expenditure £19, 19. 6—result, happiness. Annual

income £20, annual expenditure
The blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered,

misery.

20. 0. 6—result,

the God of Day goes down upon the dreary scene,
and—and in short you are forever floored. As Iam.”

The saving of a part of one's in-
come was always a good policy.

Prudent men and women have
always maintained a margin of
saving. -

But to-day we must go farther in’

our cffarts to save than ever before.

To-day it is~a matter of the
gravest. importance that each
Canadian seek ways and means
to economize by cutting down ex-
penditures for unnecessary things,
saving the money he ‘spends on
things he could do without, so

that when the Nation needs to

borrow money he will be in a posi-
tion to do his full duty.

Published under the authority of the ~

Thereis warshortening work wait--
ing for every dollar that can be
saved. :

IE Charles Dickens were writing

to Canadians to-day he would
probably give us-adyice to this
effect: BR

“My other piece of advice, Canadians,
you know. No matter what percentage
of your annual income you have pre-
viously saved; your efforts to-day should
be to save more. The advantage of so
doing is threefold: By the practice of
economy You conserve the material and
labor which must be devoted to the grim
task before us; you cultivate the priceless
habit of thrift; you gather more and
more money 0 lend to the Nation Jor the
prosecution of the war to a guick and *
“certain Viglory.". : *
