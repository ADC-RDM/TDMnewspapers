ally speaking, the number
of cggs gradually goes down.from
week to week from September to
January and then there {8 a slow but
gradual (ncrease until March, April
and May, which’ in Ontario are the

hest months for epg production.

It i5 unusual, and in most casos
very unwise, to publish figures in re-
gard to experiments until “the me-
terinl has been very thoroughly fesi-
edy but in this particular case, con-
sidering the high, cost of feeds and
the general scareity of new laid eggs,
we are giving the figures on a rather
short test of but! four weeks’ dura-
tion, The results| appear to be gen-
erally true in all pens tested and are
{n accord with reguits obtained elsec-
where. }

to hold sufMcient!?eed for the long
