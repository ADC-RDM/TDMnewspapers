Corn root rot, a disease which

time seems to be more prevalent now
than at any<recent corn harvesting

Ohio Experiment Station. Inquiries
regarding the disease so far have
come In largest numbers from south-
western Ohlo.

The disease, for which no easy
method of prevention has yet been
worked out, may infest either the soil
or the seed corn but seems to cause
more damage In flelds growing corn
continuously than where regular crop
rotations are followed. However, on
experimental plots where soll has not
been grown for several years until
this season, the root rot has made an
appearance, indicating that the fun-
gus may be transmitted in the seed.

Many reasons, social as well as re-

decline of family prayers, to which
Sir Joseph Maclay pleads we should
return. An Ingenious observer point-
ed out a few years ago that family
prayers remained the order of the day

fasted together. Disruption came in
he asserted, In houses. Up to that
time people took thelr morning bath
in thelr bedrooms and got downstairs
simultaneously. When they took-—-it
fn succession in the bathroom, break-
fast became a series of semi-detached
meals, for the first bather had fin-
ished before the last had begun. With
the family circle thus broken, family
prayers gradually disappeared. Clean-
liness had ousted godliness

Agriculture, Toronto.)

 

HE first point to observe In
the packing of butter, in
order to have it keep well
for winter use is to have
good butter. The best butter for
packing Is usually made In tho
months of June and September. It is
preferably made from comparatively
sweet cream which has been pasteur-
ized. However, on the farm pasteur-
zation is not commonly followed,
hence the butter should be mado
when the weather {8 comparatively
cool and the cream should be churn-
ed before It becomes very sour—in
fact, the sweeter the cream the more
likely It is to produce good keeping
quality in the butter, so long as there

is sufficient acid in the cream to give
good churning results.

The cream should be churned in
the usual way, except that the butter
may be washed once with brine,
which {8 made by dissolving salt In
walter, instead of using water at both
washings. Salt at the usual rate—
but not over one ounce of salt per
pound of butter, because salt does
not preserve butter as is commonly
supposed, except in a minor degree
for unpasteurized “cream butter, “It
{8 a mistake, however, to add so
much salt that the fine flavor of the
butter is covered up.

Having worked the butter as us-
ual, pack It firmly into crocks, tubs
or boxes, If unparafined wooden
packages are used, these should be
soaked several days in salt water to
prevent “woody’ flavor in the butter,
A better plam is to coat the inside
of the tub or box with hot wax, then
line with heavy parchment paper, be-

 

fore packing the butter. Glazed
crocks which are clean, need no
lining. >

When the package is full, prefer-
ably all from one churning, smooth
the top of the butter, cover with
parchment paper or a clean e¢otton
cloth, then tie heavy brown paper
over the top and place (n a cool
cellar or In cold storage. Sometimes
a salt paste is put on top of the cloth
or paper and this, is kept moist by
sprinkling .©on water from time to
time. This «@xcludes the air and helps
to keep ther butter,

We recommend packing the butter
in solid form: which 18 to be kept for
some time, rather than holding the
butter in priints, even though these
may be submerged In brine.—Prof.

Select Seed Corn Now.

Unless éveryy precaution fs taken
this autumn tthe supply of good seed
corn of the diesirable varieties will
be inadequate: for the requirements
The: autumn of 1917 saw
the corn crop lharvested with an ex-
eess of moisture, Wet cold weather
followed, durlmg which time the corn
did not cure, consequently, when the

very cold weather of December set

in the corm was frozen and germinn-
tion was reduced to a very low per-
centage. This situntion which caused
the agricultural authorities of North
America 50 much anxiety during the
winter and spring of 1918, and
which was described by them as “a
national callamity,” is not yet averted.
The problem which that committee
had to face was one of supplying
North Annerica with seed which
would give a fair germination. To

secre this seed Wns no easy task
and recourse was made to districts
in the United States hundreds of
miles to the south of Ontario which
produce large, late maturing varie-
ties, In bringing this seed Into the
country there was little expectation
that It would produce much grain,
but it was hoped it would produce
fodder, ‘The situation in Ontario was
80 acute that an embargo was placed
on the seed grown in Kent and Essex
Counties prohibiting the exportation
from those counties to other districts
in Ontario. Some seed of fair germ-
ination was available, but not suf-
client for all their local needs, and
as those counties located in southern
and western Ontario furnish the
chief source of seed for the remain-
der of the province it was felt that
such action was justified in order to
conserve those varieties for seed pur-

bores which had proven themselves |

adapied to Ontario conditions.

There was never a time in On-
tario’s history when it was more ne-
ceasary \o take every precaution in
the select oh of seed corn than at the
present Uine, The most satisfactory
method of geed sclectién is that of
selecting iy (he eld. The grower can
80 up and gown his rows and select
those ears which are early, well de-
veloped any pogiesa all varietal
characterisijcs, © When selecting in
the fleld thy grower has before him
Ho can select
from tho§y plants which possess the
height, firength, leafiness and earll-

type li established in the grower's
mind good progress can be ‘made in
selecting the ears. This method of-
fers many advantages over that of
pelecting from the shock or from the
crib, The crib is the least desirable,
“in that It offers only huaked ears to
helect from. With the shock, when
husking, the grower has the wilted or
‘matured stalks, while the fleld seclec-
tion has everything In Its favor, the
whole plant and its’ environment
which may mean normal or abnormal
conditions for velopment. — Dr.
C. A. Zavitz, O. A. College, Guelph.

THE CANADA FOOD BOARD SAYS:
Be :

Do householders in Canada seek to
evade the food regulations? Are the
merchants of Canada conniving at the
evasion of the food regulations? Let
us see about that.

The main objective of the Canada
Food Board is to supply Great Britain
and the Allles with vital foods. With
this in view food regulations are
made, which, If respected by the peo-
ple of Canada, will enable Canada to
keep falth with her Allies on food.

Do the people of Canada want to
keep faith with the Allies on food?
THEY DO. Are the people of Canada
keeping faith with the Allies on food?
THEY ARE?

To take any other position Is to sug-
gest that the people of Canada would
rather keep thelr pre-war food habits
than keep faith with the Allles on
food. No true Canadian is breaking
the regulations of the Canada’ Food
Board for he knows those regulations
are made in order that Great Britain
and the Allies and the Canadian army
at the front may be properly fed.
Who of us will eat what should be
conserved for the Canadian Army at
the front?

The hearts of the people of Canada
are sound and In this war to a finish.
Food is a first-class munition of war
and Canadians so view (t. It will be

  

time enough to. go in for rations in »

Canada* when the people of Canada
refuse to conform to national efforts
to conserve food for Great Britain
and the Allies, and the Canadian Army
at the front. When that time comes,
a Policeman, not a Food Controller,
will 'be needed.
