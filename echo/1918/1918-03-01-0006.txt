Hon. Daniel. Gllmour, a New Bruns-

at his home in Montreal from heart
failure. He was born July 1st, 1848, at
St. George, N.B. Mr. Gillmour was
summoned to the Senate on January
15th, 1907. He was a Liberal.

Everyone will tell you that It Is
bad luck to pass a pin without pleKing

fell off and rolled into the gutier. Two
suspender buttons gave way, his collar

A recent cable from London stated
that the present mét ration in Great
Britain is not more than one-half of;
the amount to which the people have
been accustomed. Accompanied as it Is
is by the restrictions on the consump-
‘tion of bread it cammot but entail

LEGISLATIVE NOTES.

In Une with the suggestion of Mr.
McDonald (Lib. member. for North
Bruce) made during the Budget debate
Iast week;a reduction in the personnel
of the Ontario License Board has been
made, Mr. McDonald has pointed out
the saving which could be effected in
this way.and suggested that with the
Temperance Act in force flve mem:
bers were not required. The Board
has been reduced to three, which will
save to thé“ Province between $8,000
and $10,000 a year.

by Mr. Proudfoot. toyremove the dis.
qualification of women os candidates

ship of J2 C7 Elliott (West Middlesex).

berta and British Columbia, two having

The chief difficulty In bi-lingual
schools, according to the Pri Min-
ister, is still a lack of properly quall®
fled teachers. This statement was in
reply to om Interrogation by. Thomas
Marshall, of Lincoln, as to what pro-
gress was being made in these schools,
as he copld find no mention made of
them in the last report of the Depart-
ment of Education.

Sam Carter (South Wellington) has
asked when the report.of the auditors
who were appointed to audit the ac-
counts of the Hydro-Electric Power
‘Commission of Ontario, will be pro-
sented to the House,

‘A patriotic resolution was unani-
mously passed by the House reaffirm-
ing its’ belief In the righteousness of
the cause of the Allies in the present
war. A copy will be sent to the Com-
manding Officer of the Canadian over-
ecas. Both sides of the House were
omphatic in appreciation of the heroic
achiévements of the Canadian boys at
the front. The Prime Minister de-
scribed the war aims of the Allie as
being “reparation for wrongs . done
and security that those whongs may
not be repeated.” Mr. Proudfoot
praised the British navy, He also
made reference to the reports of poor
accommodation being provided for re-
turning soldiers. - He thought “the
best cabins on the finest liners were
none too good for men who were sick
of maimed in the war.” Both the Pre-
mior and the Opposition leader press-
of home the necessity for greater pro-
duction of foodstuffs, and in pledging
the resources of Ontario for the carry-
ing on of the war, called upon the peo-

Conditions in tie Bngiish-French
schools throughout the Province are
showing general improvement, Sir
Wiliam Hearst tdd the members of
the Legisisture a1 Thursday after-
noon. The schools in Essex and Kent
counties are compying with the regu-
lations, the Premier sald, and there is
a general improvement in the northern
part of the provuce. The Government
finds that the cifef difficulty is the lack
of teachers with the necessary qualifi-
cations to teact in these schools.

The Attorney-General told S. Du-

45.000 additional troops will be se
cured. Toronlo’s share Is estimated |
at 2,500, or two and a half battalions |
at war strength.

The military aunthorities estimate
that a total of 75,000 troops will be
obtained by calling out the first class
onder the Act. This estimate, of
conrse, is based upon the expectations |
that the qumestion of exemptions in
Quebec will be cleared up fairly and

amount in the sstimates of $100,000 to
be msed for general grants and com-
tingencies. Heretofore afl of the
schools have not received the full am.
ount of their grants from the Govern-
ment.

Z. Mageau (Sturgeon Falls) was not
satisfied with the information given
by the Mmisters. He wanted to know
Ir all the schools would benefit by thé
grant, particularly those in which
English and French are taught. Hon.
Mr. Lucas and the Prime Minister par-
ried that any information desired
could be secured, and that they were
not conversant with the detalls.

Mr. Mageau protested that the Min-
ister of Lands, Forests and Mines, ait-
ing for the Minister of Education, last
Year, put questioners off in the same
way, for fear capital would be made
out of the information.

“I won't allow the honorable member

OHIO NEEDS SEED CORN.
Crop of 1917 Has Little Value for
Planting This Spring.

Most of tho ‘corn harvested In Ohio |

in;1917 is not fit for seed, according
to the Oklo Experiment Station, which |
has been testing ncariy two thou and |
somples representing almost every
county in the state. Crib and field
lots range in germination from 1 to 40
per cent.

Corn gathered anc stored under
artificial drying conditions before the
freézing weather last Drecmber show
90 to 100 per cent. germination In these
tests. Half of the corn i:ept from the
crop of 191% tests that high, and three-
fourtha of such cemples arc above £0 |
per cont.

Sced corn this sprifz must come
from throe sources: A-few farmers
stored thelr coin carly so’ that it was
well dried out when cold weather
came. Some corn matured compara-
tively carly in nouthern counties and
can be used fn that part of the State,
All old corn from 1916 should be held
for seed and tested for germination.

Since Jozal seed corn Js always
safest, the Experiment Station advises |
fproiers to buy as near home as pos:
sible and to test cach car. before
planting. The “rag doll” test is easily
made at home, A cloth about 10 by
60 Inches Is marked off in ‘40 squares |
In each’of which cre placed six kernels
irom an ear numbered to correspond
with the number given the Speco on

The cloth Isrolled up, soaked In

The report was adopted.

Mayor Park gave notice of motion
for a~standard milk by-law, controlling
the sale of milk.

Mr. Wigle wanted to know if there

had been’any inquiry into whether the
Essex Terminal Road purposed com:
ing into Amherstburg and the advis-
ability of ‘the council appointing- a
committee to wait on the management
with a view to urging them to extend
their line from the quarry here.
+ Mayor Park said that a few weeks
ago he ‘had Interviewed Mr. Woollatt,
and that the company had no present
intention of coming t0 Amherstburg,
nor of carrying passengers,

Mr. Wigle urged that a representa.
tive. committee should be appointed.
He had been told that Mr. Wdollartt
informed one of Amherstburg’s repre- |
sentative citizens that it was their in-
tention to extend thelr line into Am-
herstburg when the time came,

Reeve Brown corroborated what the
Mayor had sald.. He had also spoken
to Mr. Woollatt, and received no en
couragement.

Mr. Wigle again pressed the matter,
because as the switching charges wore
absorbed by the trunk lines, and as
these trunk lines are other than the
M. C. R. he believed It would mean &
saving of several thousand dollars a
year to the merchants of Amherstburg
to have this line enter the town.

He urged that a representative
bunch of citizens get up close to the
Essex Terminal Rallway and press our
claims upon them;

Reeve Brown moved that this coun-
cll adopt clause 4 of the communica:
tion from Guelph re a’ compulsory poll
tax.

The motion was seconded by Mr.
Craig and cafried.

Mr. Crimmins introduced a-discus-
sion on the new method of collection
employed by the Essex Countv Light
Co. by which they are requiring a
surety deposit of from $6 to $9 from
citizens of the town to guarantee their
accounts.

Moved by Mr. Crimmins, seconded
by Mr. Bertrand, that the Clerk com-
municate with Mr. Hayes, manager
of the Essex County Light Co., re pird-
ing the matter—Carried.

Mr.Wigle again brought the council
back to the matter of the Essex Ter-
minal, and moved, seconded by Mr.
Denike, that Messrs. Crimmins, Brown
and Denike be a committee to gather
the necessary information regarding
the amount of freight handled here, to
be presented. to the managements of

ed by Messr. Crimmins-and Bertrand,
that Mr. Hadley be notified by. the

C. ‘A. Cuddy/addressed the council
with reference to a fixed assessment
on the Lake View Hotel to permit the
proprietor to re-open his hotel under
the new conditions without license.
He urged the council to meet Mr. Fox
fairly so as to encourage a good ho-
tel, which was badly needed here.

Mayor Park—*“Is Mr.. Fox prepared
to. name a reasonable price for the
sale ‘of his hotel?”

Mr. Cuddy—*Yes, he is."

Mayor Park thought “it might be
feasible for the municipality to take
over the hotel and run it for the muni-
cipalty, as-is done in other towns.
Sometimes the burden of taxation is
relleved fn this way.

Mr. Cuddy—"I'd want to take about
10 cents worth of the stock. Mr. Fox
quotes the Lake View at $15,000, which
is below the mark.” :

Reeve Brown—“If the town gave
him any concessions he should be pre-
pared to agree to keep the place open
the year round.”

Mr. Cuddy—"That avould=he part of
the agreement.”

Mr. Rutherford addressed the coun-
cll regarding the proposed water pro-
position of the Brunner, Mond. At
both the public meetings, held to dis-
cuss this matter, he had been assured
by the business men and ratepayers
that he could go ahead and purchase
material for the waretworks and the
proposition would go through. “but
there was now a rumor that the peo-
ple were showing considerable oppo-
sition. He thought Inasmuch as he
had been given the assurance of the
meetings that the proposition was ac-
ceptable to them and only to wait for
the new voters’ list, that the by-law
should now be put up to the people and
see if they were going to turn it
down, before the town goes to a great

A good’ deal of material had been
bought and fre Brunner, Mond «didn't
want to be left with « half pur
chased waterworks on thelr hands. He
urged that the question be ‘submitted
to the people and let them say whether
they want it on not.

Mayor Park—*Mr. Dallyn has prom-
ised to be here at the earliest possible
date and discuss this with the town
from all standpojmts.”

Mr. Denike thought the people had
no chance yet to Took into any alter-
native proposition, because we have
put off from time to time the engaging
of an outside enginegr.

Mr. Crimmins believed the by-law
would be defeated.” The meetings held
were not, as unanimously in favor of
it as, they appeared to be, was* his
opinion. .

Mayor Park undérstood that it was
24 question of maving the intake above
the B. M. sewer entirely: Insreturn
for thi the Brugner, Mond is offering
to build a’ brand new waterworks to
replace one about worn. out, and de-
liver water at aur border at cost. Many
things about the plant are at an end.
One pump {s_30 years old, one boller
23 years old. The plant may last two
or three years; but we must replace
them soon: , The whole question Is,
Is the Brunner, Mond price a fair,
square one. pid

Alr. Crimmins—*“That's_ just ‘why we
want an outside engineer to see if the
B. M. proposition fs right. If we ae-
cept the proposition, it means spend-
hg $40,000 or $50,000 for a new main

Mr. Cralg—"\Where did you get

Mr. Crimmins—“From. a ‘hardware

The discussion drifted into the size
of Mains required In the east end of |

that in the next two or three
