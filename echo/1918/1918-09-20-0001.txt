It is a comforting thought among
Oddfellows throughout the world that
after they “go west” thelr brethren
keep their memories and thelr grayes
green, and at least once a’ year in a
body visit the “city of the dead” and
lovingly place floral tributes upon each
grave and conduct the memorial ser-
vice ol, the Order, which. through
intimate association has become fa-
millar as the ritual to all members.
Sunday last this annual memorial was
held by Rose Lodge, No. 28, LO.O.F,
