Hellam, Pa.—“T took Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg-
etable Compound for female troubles and a dis-
placement. Ifelt all rundown and was very weak.
1 had been treated by a physician without results,
80 decided to give Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
a trial, and felt better right away. I am keeping house
since last April and doing all my housework, where before
I was unable to do any work. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Oompound is certainly the best medicine a Woman can

take when in thiscondition. I give you permission to publish
this letter.” —Mrs. E. R. CruMLINg, R. No. 1, Hellam, Pa.

remedies to all suffering women who are troubled in a simi.

Look around you! Look around you!

If you have not yet decided to plant a vegetable garden make up your mind to
do so now. You will not regret it. There-is still lots of time. Potatoes and beans may (
