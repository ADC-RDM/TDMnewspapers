Members of the grand juries -do
not consider their positions any sine-

taken by a number who have been
empaneled for the winter assizes that

Whose nearest neighbor lives a mile
away, had been forced to leave his
farm. and the feeding and- care of 50

Impossible to secure assistance, as his
only son is overseas at the front. In
spite of the reasonable protestations
of this juror there Is no meangof re-

VOTE ON ESSEX SEWAGE
SYSTEM TO BE MARCH 30th

Plans of the Essex Border Utilities
Commission for a temporary sewage
system to serve, Windsor, Wajkerville,
Ford, Sandwich, Ojfbway and Sand-
wich West are advanced so far that
councils” of the municipalities, will be
asked to submit by-laws to the rate-
payers authorizing a debenture {ssue
to cover cost of the work. Saturday,
March 30th, has been chosen by the
comission to take the vote,
tThe total cost of the s m [8s placed
at $210,000. Windsor's share will*be
$26,000, and’ Ford, which is without
any drainage system will be asked-to
pay .the ‘largest proportion.

The system if approved, will empty
all treated sewage below the Windsor
intake. At present the raw HOWNnge, of
Walkerville and” Ford is discharged
above the city watérworks. An edfot
of thé International Waterways com-,
mission to prevent pollution of the
akes and rivers compelled thé commis-
sion to plan for a new system of
sewage for all the Canadian border
municipalities.
