pigs were used in the experiment. In
this case 21 pounds of pork were pro,
duced from each bushel of corn whe
168 pounds of skimmilk was fed wi
it. Comparative tests with the skim
milk-fed hogs shows a return of only
a little more than 11 pounds of pork
Por "to the bushel when corn alone was
fed. :

- Rations which may be more profit-
ably used than corn alone for hogs
are: corn 9 parts, tankage 1 part; corn J
6 parts, linseed ofimeal 1 part; corn
1 part, skimmilk 3 parts. Green pas- |
ture crops are comparatively high in
protein, in which corn Is deficient, and
may be used to reduce but cannot en:
tively supplant, the use of some
nitrogenous concentrate.
