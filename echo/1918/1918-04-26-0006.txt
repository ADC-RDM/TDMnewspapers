1 could scarcely work. I tried
various remedies without receiving
any benefit. 1 consulted a doctor,
bat he was unable to cure me.
“Then a friend recommended
Zam-Buk. The improvement after
asing the first box was surprising.
I continued until the boils had en-
tirely disappeared, a®d- 1 have
never had any return since.”
Zam-Buk is also unequalled for
eczema, ulcers, abscesses, scalp
sores, ringworm, blood-poisoning,
piles, cuts, bums, scalds, etc. All
druggists, or Zam-Buk Co., Toronto;
