BREIL ars be phase of horror,
rn a Boxing day, when
the first whispers renche,
ed us of the
destruction of the oll flelds. Frankly
we had, each and every one of us, cont
pletely forgotten the oll! A nab. a
friend of ours, drove up In 4 motor,
streaked with grime, weary and dead
to the world. After lunch he started
to tell his story, fortified by a big
cigar.

He had been one of a party who
went out nlone to the petro) elty to
destroy. No one would elve them
help, and he told us wonderful ac-
counts of the scenes which he had wit-
nessed. The first step hmd been to
enpture every single man nnd boy who
knew anything about the petrol plans
and deport them bodily to Moldavia,
so that the Germans should find no
skilled workmen to ‘utilize to thelr
own profit. And then a few palrs of
hands sufficed to crumble and lay In
ashes what many hundreds of bralns
had worked to bulld. First-they broke
up all the machinery—the how of the
happening is Immaterial; the most
primitive and brutal wen pons served
them best. Then they poured benzine
from the roofs of factories down thelr
walls and set them alight, they dug
trenches round the vats and started
blazing channels of flame toward the
reservoirs, These blew up each In turn,
and soot and flumes made of what had
been sunlight an eternal night where
the fire king went mad. "Town by town

Making Shrapnel.

New Inventions have been mide by
Americans, - and American machine
tools for shell making have been gent
to Europe and are used In the factories
there. The number of shells of shrap- |
nel made In this country Is almost be-
vand computatign. Long before we en:
tered the war our different factories
were turning out. hundreds of thoy-
sands of shrapnel a week, and It was
due to this demand for munitions that
ennbled us to turn out the big hroduct
we are now making. This 8 go not
only of shrapnel, but of powder and
explosives of all kinds. Before the war
one company was making aboyt 400.

SULTAN IS FOND OF READING
Turkey's Ruler for Weeks at a Time

Shuts Himself in Private Suite,
* Surrounded With Books.

Although the sultan of Turkey Is
reputed to be the Inziest potentiate In
Europe, he is passionately: fond of
reading. For weeks at an time he will
shut himself In his private sulte, sur-
rounded by literature of all kinds—
classleal works, novels, magazines und
newspapers. With the exception of
his personnl attendants and ministers
of state, no one {8s nlowad In the Im-
perinl sanctuary during the sultan's
literary “fits.”

But the sultan is at something of a
disadvantage, says a British weekly,
beenuse his knowledge of Luropedn
langpages Is limited.

In order to overcome the difflenlry
he employs a translation oflice. Here
there are officials who speak all the
languages of Ruropod and the Dust
They rend all the pdlitical and
trated newspapers of Importance, nnd
translate extracts from them for the
sultan. There are 15 superior trons.
lators, called dragomnh secretaries, In
that office, and thelr pay Is from ten
to forty Turkish pounds monthly.

They do not Ilmlit thelr transintions
to political publications; they trans-
Inte novels and romances In all lan-
guages for the Sultan. and nny
thousand volumes of their work have
found thelr way (nto the imperial lib-
rary. They are-all written on thick,
white, royal, octavo, glit-edge paper,
nnd are fastened together with
green and red ribbons by the transla-
tors themselves.

After circulating through the harem
they are preserved in the library. The
sultan's. favorite reading 18 criminal
romances. He subscribes to all news
papers that contain reports of the
proceedings In the law “courts, and
there is no famous writer of stories
of crime In any language whose works
have not been translated for him.

HOW TO USE COAL PROPERLY

House Should Not Be Allowed to De-
come So Warm That Doors and
Windows Are Opened. i
+

If you want to save coal never al-
low the houfie to get so hot that you
have to throw open the windows nnd
doors. Thermostats are cheap these
days. They automatically slow down
the ‘fire when the temperature 1s ris-
ing to the uncomfortable point.

To get the most out of the heat In
coal, the house alr should be changed
once nn hour. Arrangements for such
a change should have been made when
the house was bullt. But if that was
overlooked when the house was bullt
you can get the chante of alr In sev-
eral ways, says n writer in the Awmerl-
ean Magazine. I do not belfeve In get-
ting this result by having loose win-,
dows, as we used to do on the farm.
1 prefer tight windows, carefully
weather-stripped. If that has not been
arranged for, or If the cost is too
great, 1 find that storm windows are
relatively cheapd Then, alr slats which
let in alr when you want {t are good.

"An Actor's Wish.

One of the company sald he regretted
greatly that he was not: eligible, but
he hoped that he might do his bit in
some way on this side. He sald: “I
would even be willing to go to France

British Government Has Done Well In

Converting Vast Tracts Into Areas

> of Cultivation.

Since William the Conqueror first
Inld waste to a smiling countryside’ to
make a deer park, and forbade com-
mon men to hunt In that great tract
he called his “New Forest,” milllons of
acres of fertile English land have
served no purpose useful to the race.
The nobles of medieval times, and thelr
children's children after them, loved
above all things the chase, and they
pald scant heed to those beneath them
who sought to draw thelr living from
the soll. If there were room for deer,
and foxes, and hares, and moor and
marshland for falcons to soar above,
or gentlemen to shoot over, they did
not care. ;

England was prosperous and secure.
Many years ago her governments defl-
nitely abandoned the Iden of making
the land self-supporting. The sens were
safe to British commerce, and none be-
lleved the time would come when the
nation's needs would compel the use
of pleasure parklands, The country
grew old gracefully, and enjoyed It.
It wns not decadent, only too well ‘con-
tent. y

All this the war has changed, and
for the better. Britannia still rules
the waves, but beneath the waves lle
unseen terrors, menacing the nation's
commerce, Its food supply, Its very
life, The nation cannot trust its sen-
borne trade now, It must utilize every
possible means to provide tHe neces-
sary sustenance for {ts armies, and for
those who supply the fighting men.
And the British government rises to
the occasion.

Before the yvar Lloyd George tought
long and well to compel the breaking
up of old estates, to make possible the
cultivation of land long Idle, to give

falled, for the British’ are conservative

SON NOW,

In three years past the British gov.

Indeed, found necessary the establish.

this work of national regeneration. * It
{s_a great change, and one that should
not be regretted. The English which
makes peace will not be the England of
{ts fathers, but a bétter one, less ats
tractlve, It may be, to tourists, less
bénutiful to look upon externally, but,
surely, far more of an Inspiration to Its
neighbors which travel, in company,

Beyond Writer's Power.

Coningsby Dawson says, in telling of
his disloclination to keep even n note
book after he went tosthe front, though
he had been a professional writer:

“One has an strange feeling about
books when he Is In the Immediate

anecdote of a great Swedish writer
which partly illustrates ‘my mood.
The watchers hy his bedside- thought
he was dead. Suddenly he raised him-
self up. Lid

“ Now-F could write,’ he whispered.
They were his last words.

“In the light .of my experience at

cloak In words and call literature
geem so Ignoble a presentation of men
and women who are planned for Im-
mortality and live In’an Infinite world.

“That prohibition reminds me ofin

about thelr peaches, pears and plums.
For how ever can they can when

The process Is to take the fruits
