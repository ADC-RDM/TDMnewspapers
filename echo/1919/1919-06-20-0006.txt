Interesting Relics Coming to the

United States.

Expedition Under the Auspices of the
Pennsylvania University Museum
Has Been Highly Successful
in Its Explorations.

Despite handicaps caused by the
war, the Pennsylyynia University wu-
seum has ‘acquired many relics un-
earthed at Memphis by its Egyptian
expedition. A vessel will be char-
tered to transport the relics.

The expedition started on its trip
in March, 1915, and continued explor-
ations until last June, when the short-
sage of labor and the high prices of
materials due to the war, caused 4
cessation. In the work,

A representative of the Roumanlan
government had obtained the conces-
sion of the whole site, but the war In-
tervened and the Egyptian expedis
tion offered the university party the
choice of any portion. An area near
the colossl of Rameses II was select
ed, because of the discoveries made In
that region by an inspector of an-
tiquities for lower Egypt. He hud re-
vealed what was app: arently the room
of a Pharaoh's paluce!

Excavations by the
university museum proved the bulld-
ing to be the royal residence of Me
penptah, who ruled from 1225 B. C. to
1215 B. C. The expforers found three
layers of earth, representing the an-
cient location of as many civilizations.
A large Roman city had occupled the
site of the topmost luyer, underneath
which were large masses of masonry
belonging to the period estimated to
have been 332-30 B, C, nnd the lowest
layer revealed rulns of the palace of
Menenptah at a total distance of from
sixteen to eighteen feet below the sur-
face level.

The palace, which had been unhgrm-
ed ‘by the natives, apparently had
been a magnificent structure, Lirme-
stone was the material used for the
columns and fraumings, while the outer
walls were of sun-dried brick. The
eastern wing of the palace, shich was
the first to “be excavated, contulved
magnificently decorated apartments
where the Pharaoh 'and his wife (ort
wives) spent their time,

Old-Fashioned Flint Lock Said to Have
Been Brought to Wisconeln
Town by Southerner.

Danlel Boone's rifle, a genuine old-
fashioned flint lock, carried by Boone
on many a perilous trip In the dark
und bloody hunting ground of Ken-
tucky and on his fumous Indian hunt
Ing expeditions, was recently brought
into u hardware store in a small town
in southwestern Wisconsin for much

{ needed repairs. It Is now the prop-

| erty of u Mr. Rafter, formerly of Mis-
sissippl, who recently traded his 2,300
acre plantation for Wisconsin property
and has moved his effects north. The
rifle was given him by a doctor, to
whom it had been given by an aged
hermit living in the mountains of Ten-
nessee,

The rifle {fs a formidable affair, a
real “long rifle,” one of the type that
gave the nickname of the “long rifles”

| 10 our western frontersmen. It has
a barrel 46 inches long, is 45 caliber,
a flint lock with a patchbox of in-
Inid silver, and weighs ten pounds.
The end of the butt is set with a wild
boar's tusk, and has the double or set
trigger. On the side of the stock are

| carved with a jackknife the words,
“Boon's “Tru Kren,” on the walnut
stock the initials D. B. and five most
significant and sinister notches, each
notch standing for “one good Injun.”
At the lower end of the stock Is a long

and deeply cut gash suid to have been
cut by an Indian tomahawk thrown at

| Boone. What happened to the Indian
is not recorded.

The rifle, badly broken in shipment,
Las been repaired and is now on ext
hibition.—Exchange.

ENDLESS CHAIN NOT MYSTICAL

Doctor Fighting Influenza Explains
How Curative Serum Went From
Patient to Patient.

The prevalence of I[nfluenza and
pneumonia with their high death rate
makes it imperative to resort to herole
methods of treatment rather-than to
follow the accepfed ones only. The
lack of serum other specific remedy
for Influenza writes Dr. Charles R.
Humbert In the Medical Record, to-
gether with the inability to obtain
antipneumococcus serum forced me to
use convalescent serum.

The Endless Crhain—It Is a well-
known fact that persons convalescing
from pneumonia have anti-bodles in
their blood streams. As soon as the
patients’ condition permits, therefore,
they are bled as much and as frequent-
1¥ as pgssible,

Serum is prepared and treated, and
is placed in stock. "V hen, another pa-
tient comes in with pneumonia, treat-
ment is begun. , When convalescence
sets in the above procedure is repeat-
ed. It Is a case of one gives serum to
twvo, two gives serum to three and; so
on, the procedure becoming endless.

Censor’s Office Roy.

It must be the censor's office boy
who Is responsible for some of the va-
garies of the blue pencil. “Not long ago
some “patriotic sonl quoted Kipling’s
line from the “Recessional,” “The cap-
tains and the kings depart.” | He had
the surprise of his life when the word
“kings” “was struck out! But worse
Is now ‘reported.’ Another Scribe,
greatly daring: in the meatless’ days,
quoted Thomds Hood's joke In an ars
ticle: on. “Wayside Graves,” or some-
thing equally ‘solemn :

“So they. buried Ben at. four cross
roads
With a stake in his inside. 3

That was too much for the censor's
office boy. A ‘stake in his inside, in-
deed. The censor's office-boy knew If
he’ knew how to spell that fhé food
controller would never sanction” a

"whole {‘'steak”—a nice, succulent, julcy

steak, in anybody's Inside. So he de-
leted the offending lines. Who shall
say that Wwe are mot urdently patri-
atit people?—=Lindon News.

Slow Sartorial Reconstruction.

The question of, civilian equipment
has dts humorous a8 well as its seri-
ous aspects for the “honorobly dis-
charged soldiér or sailor. Some are
Jucky enough to return immediately
and, completely to “cits,” while others,
less fortunate, must content .them-
selves with a sort of half and half
adornment... It no longer causes
astonishment to detect a pair of neat-
ly creased trousers hanging stiffly be-
neath military ‘khaki overcoat, or to
see the $hort blue jacket of the sailor
covering an otherwise perfect elvillan
outfit. These are some of the minor
problems of reconstruction.—New

= Remarkable Repair Ship.

To enable the American destroyers
and chasers in British waters mmes|
diately to effect repairs and renewals,
there was a. repair ship stationed at
Queenstown of a remarkable charac.

was a floating machine shop, foundry
and store, able to do any kind of re-
pair work shart of drydock work. The
bakery produced long loaves of crust-
ed bread for all the ships, and once
created a most elaborate birthday
cake for Admiral Sims,
