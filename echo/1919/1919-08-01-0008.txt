[F I KNEW YOU AND YOU KNEW ME

If I knew you and you knew me,’ When'er we ship you'by mistake, ; Or when some goods you “fre back,” Then let no doubting thoughts abide

Or make a “kick” in this or that, Of firm good faith on either side;
y We'd take it in good part, yo) see, :
But never having yet clasped hands, From irritation you'd be free, If I knew you and you knew me.

'Tis seldom we would disagree; Or in your bill some error niake,
Confidence to each other give

Both often fail to understand : If I knew you and you knew me. i With customers thousands strong Living ourselves, let others live,

Occasionally “things g0 wrong— But any time you come this way,

. . x Fes
That each intends to do what's right, Or when the checks don’t come on time,
Sometimes our fault, sometimes theirs—

o ” That you will call we hope and pray,
And treat each other “honor bright. And customers send us nary a line, Forbearance would decrease all cares; :

How little to complain there'd be ! We'd wait without anxiety, Kind friends, how pleasant things would be Then face to face we each shall see,

If I knew you and you knew me. : If 1 knew you and you knew me. . . If I knew you and you knew me. And I'll know you and you'll know me.
