BASEBALL.

Amherstburg Wins From Leamington.

 

 

The Amherstburg basebail , club
motored to Leamington Thursday of
last week and crossed bats with the
pickle preservers, and after a hard
game came through ‘victorious, store
5 to 2. To begin the story of the bat-
tle, much credit is due to Beilecoure's
fine pitching and the support given
him by his teammates. He allowed
but’ two measly hits, one in the 7th
and the other in the 8th, so anyone
can see that hey were not doing any-
thing with his fast ones. He is cred-
ited with seven strikeouts, which is
very good when considering what he
was up agzinst In the way ol heavy
batters, and Leamington his some
very clever ones. Rubber Hamilton
two clever plays and
also showed great, headwork by mak-
ing a false throw to home and instead
whipped The apple to Mailloux and
caught the runner off his'base. Spry
came through with two real hits that
started Amherstburg on {ts way to
victory. Bud himself got a hit good
for two bags, but got no assistance in
Leam-

tent of playing good ball also, but
can’t mention anyone who should be
shown particular attention. As stated
previously they got two hits, mepely
scratch ones, They are fart in ‘the
field,~but could do nothing at the bar,
and it takes hitters to bring home the
bacon and eggs. Anothér feature
worth considerable mention was the
manner in which both vmplires han-
dled the game and no rag chewing on
the field by either team. Tle atten-
dance was ie the neigliborhood of
1.500, each one being nicked for 25
cents, which means money tn Lenm-

ington. Amherstburg should charge
25 cents admission and not take a

chance on) the collection, as ii takes
money to run a real ball team, and
we have one here. The battnrles for
the game were: Amherstbrrg—Belle-

GCCOMPANYING the heated

“summer days are the num-

erous thunderstorms which

infest the temperate regions
of our continent, and it is then we
need the proper answer-to the ques-
tion of practicability of lightning
rods. Contemporaneous with this
usually come the lightning 10d agents
and again a knowledge of the sub-
Ject Is necessary, To answer the
question we can do no better than
rely on the statistics of insurance
companies. Reports from these in
1913 show that 26 per cent. of their
risks were on rodded buildings. The
total number of clnims paid were
193, which amounted to $40,904.63;
of these eight were rodded and dam-_
age done only $57.64. If the rods

were no good thén 20 per cent. of
strokes should have been on rodded
buildings, or, roughly, 50 strokes.
In that year the insurance com-
panies figured an efficiency of 99.6
per cent, In Iowa the efciéncy runs
98.7 per cent. andin Michigan, where
the rodding is inspected the efMeiency
is 99.9 per cent. From these we are

{ forced to agree that lightning rods

are a protection, and we must now
consider where and how to rod.
During the year 1900 in U. S. A.
the number of persons killed by
lightning was 713, of which 291 were
killed in the open, 158 in houses, 57
under trees, and 56 in barns, of the
remainder the circumstances were
unknown. From this it appears that
it is more dangerous in tlie open than
anywhere else, The reason of this
probably is that the house, tree, ete.,
act as conductors and carry the
charge directly to the ground with-
out harming the occupants. Of those

.killed in‘ the open the most were

raised above their, surroundings, on
horse-back, a load of hay or an agri-
cultural implement.” In Schleswig-
Holstein, for the years 1874 to 1883
summary reports show that yearly
out of every million buildiogs, 549
ordinary bufldings (houses, barns),
6,277 churches, §,624 windmills, and
306 factories were struck. Naturally
the total number of churches in that
country are less than any other type
of building and yet they’ were more
often struck, which is due to their
height and especially’ of their spire.
Thus all high or projecting objects
are more ligble to be struck and
hence should be rodded.

A lightnigg vod Is merely a me-
tallic rod sunk in damp earth and
terminating in a point or

abovy a projecting structure, Now

unlike charges, of electricity attract, |

thus the charge of the cloud attracts
the oppositely induced charge on the
earth up through the rod to the point
where it slowly leaks off fnto the air
about It and thus fonizes ‘it. This
jonized or charged alr now exists
within a field of eléetrical force
which causes a current of electricity
to travel. slowly through the atmo-
sphere to the cloud which tends to
neutralize the ‘charge’ on the cloud
above the building and hence pre-
vents a discharge. However, the dis-
charge is not:always prevented as
lightning sometimes acts Avith: a
“freak nature” and a discharge qg-
curs between the clouds and the
lightning rod. This is due to a re-
versed condition being wary sudden-
ly brought about by induction and
the slow transfer ‘of electrioity
through the air has not time to dis-
charge the cloud before the flash
takes plice, It 18 now that:improper
