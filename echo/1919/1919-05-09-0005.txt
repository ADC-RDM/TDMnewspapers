in freshly drawn milk. At
temperatures between 60
deg. F. and 98 deg. F. (blood heat)
they grow and multiply rapidly,.
causing the milk to become quickly
spoiled. As the temperature falls

below 60 deg. 9., the bacterin become
less active, the changes caused by
them are less marked, so the milk
keeps sweet and in good condition

The above table shows how low
temperatures check bacterial multi-
plication in milk, This {s the scien-
tific fact upon which the practice of
milk cooling is founded.

In practice a dairyman should bear
in mind three things in connection
with the cooling of milk, First—
cool milk with as little delay as pos-

: sible after jt comes from the cow.
Second—cool milk to as low a tem-
perature as possible, say somewhere
between 40 deg. F. and 50 deg. F.
Third—cool milk with as little con-
tamination as possible from outside
gources, such as dust, dirty utensils,
water splashings, etc. If these three
points were regularly attended to by
all dairies a marked improvement in
