ture, Toronto.)
HE quality and preservation
-of silage is largely depen-
dent upon the character of
tho fermentation which
takes place mostly during the first
ten days or two weeks after the corn
is filled into the silo. In order to
control the character of the fermen-

tation so’ as to get the best results

several factors have to be taken into
consideration.

1st, The silo should be well con-
structed and have no.air leaks, Wher-
ever air penetrates it will cause rot
in the silage.

2nd. The corn should be well de-
veloped with the cobs at least in the
dough stage. If the corn is immature
the resultant silage is liable to be
too high in moisture, poor in consist-
ency and sour. Its feeding value will
be much less than that of mature
corn. x

3rd. In filling the silo the corn
should be well scattered around and
evenly packed. If steps are not tak-
en .to ensure this the heavier parts
of the corn, such ns the cobs and
stalks, will be liable to settle in one
place and the lighter leaves be blown
around to the outer edges, thus caus-
ing the development of a hard core
where the heavier pleces settle, and
a dJoft, spongy, alr-infiltrated area
where the lighter pieces fall. Such
a.condition will ruin the fermentation
and induce rot.

Phe fermentation commences prac-
tically as soon as the silage Is In the
silo, and will be good or bad accord-
ing to the, prevailing conditions as
describéd above.

The fermentation 8 induced by
plant enzymes, which are within the
plant tissues, and various species of
bacteria and yeasts, which are pres-
ent oh the corn when it is filled in.

These bacteria, yeasts and plant
enzymes act on some of the starch
and sugar that is present in the corn |
changing®he starch first to sugar and
then to acids, alcohol and carbon

| di-oxide, and various other products
lof fermentation of somewhat minor

significance.
The acids, more particularly the

| lactic acid thus produced, constitute

the preservative substance ensuring
good silage. It is desirable to get
the ‘maximum amount of lactic acid

amount of alcohol and carbon di-
oxide as these two latter pass off as
gas and thus mean loss of the sugar
content as they, as well as the lactic
acid, are made from the sugar. *
Lactic acid- bacterin are respons-
ible for the production of the lactic
acid and yeasts are mostly respons-
ible for the production of the alcohol
and much of the carbon di-oxide,
Lactic’ acid bacteria and yeasts as
some undesirable kinds of bacteria
and molds are usually present in
considerable numbers on the corn at
the time _it is’ filled’ into the silo.
The problem is to induce the lactic
acld bacteria to get ahead of the
other “kinds of Jbacterin and yeasts
that are present, as;when sufficient
lactic acid is produced it prévents the
other- kinds of bacteria and yeasts
from developing, - otherwise they
would cause 108 through undesirable
type of fermentation. <
The lactic: acid bacteria which
cause the desirable fermentation in
silage are the same as those which
cause the sourihg of milk, Conse-
quently, if freshly well-soured milk,
whieh ‘will have millions of the lactic
acid bacteria present, Is scattered
evenly oyerthe cut corn from time to
time in the silo as fv is being filled,
this-wlill ensure the presence of an
abundance of lactic acid bacteria
ready to nct right at once. so that the
requisite lactic acid will be rapidly
produced. wv
During the fermentation the silage
gradually settles and the alr that was
present in the mass gradually gets
used: up in the fermentation pro-
cesses. ~ If more adr penetrates into
