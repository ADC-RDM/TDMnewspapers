Medical Men Believe It will Again

There 1s a widespread jeljof among
medical men that the epgemic of la
grippe, or influenza, which gwept over
the world lant year, will 4gain appear
In Onnade during thi avtumn and
coming winter. Thly dongerous trou:
ble sparés neither ggze nor sex, but it
naturally finds it; easiest
among those WhG gre mm doyn In
health, or those hose blood is weak
and watory, and jt is among the lat-
ter class In which the greatest mum-
ber of faualities occur, The surest
way to prevent an attack of’ this
dreaded trouble 1s to keep the blood
rich and rure, and fhe safest and best
way toi dp this Is through the use of
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.

No reasonable precaution to avert
an attack of infiuenzn. or la grippe
should be spired. The disease Itself
is deadly, bul {ts after-effects, among
those wha {fe spared, make the life
of the vigtim one of constant misery.
Ask almi,at any of those who have
been attigked by influenza what their
present condition of health is and
most of them will answer: “Since” I
had the influenza 1 have never been
fuily well,” This troubie leaves he-
hind it a persistent weakness of the
limbs, shortness of breath, bad diges-
tion, palpitation of the heart, and a
tired feeling after even slight exer-
tion, "This {5 Que to the thin-blooded

They are at the mercy of relapses and
complications, often very serious. This
condition will contirue until the blood
is bujlt up again. and for the purpose
of building up the blood and strength-
ening the nerves nothing can equal a
fair treatment with Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, From first to last dose these
piils make new, rich blood, which
reaches every organ and nerve in the
body. Thus the lingering germs are
driven out, and the weak, despondent
victims sof influenza are transformed
into cheerful, healthy, happy men and
