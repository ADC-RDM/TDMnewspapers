§ Impressed Hunters in the Florida
Everglades So . Much They
Spared the Victor's Life.

¥

© A couple of hunters on the. border
of the Florida Everglades were sur-
prised ‘to hear the wild snorts and
whistles of a buck In fight, mingled
with the plaintive bleats of a doe in
distress—a combination of sounds that
was unaccountable. The men crept
cautiously up, and In ‘five minutes
reached the edge of an open glade.

In the center crouched a doe, wild
with terror, By her side was a* fawn
only a few hours old, still too weak
to follow (ts mather, while the old
buck, with bristling halr, and antlers
lowered, stood by, snortIng in rage nnd
defiance. His eyes, green iith rage,
followed, some object mo¥{ngiin* the
palmetto scrub on the porder of the
gile, =P

Looking carefully, tle hunters saw
a_young panther passing backward
and forward in an sffort to turn the
flank of the defense and get at the
‘fawn. A wiser beast would have abans
doned the attack &% soon as. such a
defender went on guard, but this
pirnther was evidently in the full flush
of his first strength, dnd wishont ox-
perience of the prowess of an old buck
at bay. 4 LJ

Forward and back he crawled, spit-
ting and sparling, only to find the
buck always between him and the doe.
At last he crouched for the spring.
The buck, snorting grimly, braced all
his muscles for the coming crash; he
appreciated his danger, but dared the
worst. The dos whimpered and closed
her eyes, but did not desert her fawn.

The panther rose in the alr and
eame down within ten feet of the buck.
Then the buck went into the air, and
falling with his feet; together on the
struggling cat, Seemed to stab him
through andsthrough. Immediately the
buck rose again and landed a dozen
feet away. Then he lowered his head
and plunged at the panther.

There was a confusion of flying dirt
and grass, and again the deer sprang
away. There were now deep cuts on
his head and neck, and his antlers were
splashed with red. 7
. The panther now. tried to erecp
away, but again the buck leaped, stab-
bed with his feet together and sprang
away. The cat now lay gasping, while
thé buck watched him with his hair
stiffened Into a mane and eyes that
nearly bulged from his head, Then the”
hunters walked forward.

Whén the buck saw them he must
have realized that he was completely
In their power. His proud crest fell,
and he lost allithe swelling part of the
victory; but still he showed no ‘Inten-
tion of deserting the doe, but moved
off and stood beside her. She crouched
down again with the fawn. .

. The hunters walked over quietly and
‘|examined the panther. He was very
badly’ cut up. Both shoulders were
broken, and the antlers had passed re-
pentedly through his body. During the
exnmination the buck stood quietly in
:Iplain view, and no gihdiator saluting’
