Aappily. she hod struck n wenk spot
oni he glndly accepted the lunch bas:
ket He divided everything, giving her
thellon's share, which she did not dure
refige. But If she thought to divert
14 mind from the events of last eves
alng she was mistaken, for he began
again: "Last night I was on my way
to Oakdale, where I intend, or perhaps
1 should say Intended, to spend my va-
ention, and my gasoline gave out about
five miles from town. Of course, there
was no one around, so I started to hike
it. I was making pretty good time when
just as I reached this place I saw a
man trying to get in by a window. I
tried to be n hero and the next thing
I knew I found myself In these duds
and with you pointing a gun at me. 1
wish you'd explain matters a bit.”

Anne looked at him. Was he telling
the truth? He certainly looked and
acted as though he was, but somewhere
fi» had heard of the “diabolical craftl-
ness of the Insane mind,” and—she
didn't belleve him.

SHI trying to humor him, ghe gaid:

“Pm very much obliged to you, alr,
and perhaps in a little while you can
go -

“Don’t you belleve me?” he cried, ex-
asperated.

“Oh, of course,” sald Anne, Yhut
wouldn't you like to stay with me aj «
little longer?”

“E-er, why certainly. Yd be delizht-
ed: but I do wish you'd put that beast-
ly gun down. It makes me feel rather
uncomfortable to be stiring into the |,
muzzle of a rifle all the time.”

Anne, who was really tired of hold-
{ng the heavy weapon, let it drop to
her side, but still kept her hand an It.

A silence then fell, and Anne, still
keeping one eye on the rond and the
other on her prisoner, thought over
what he had said. Evidently she had
not been dreaming, for he had been In
the fight, but who and where was the
other man? He had sald he intended
to spend his vacation at Oakdale, and
Anne found herself thinking how nice
it would be If some one like him, [n his
right mind, of course, should come to
the tiny village.

They would meet, they would form &
mutual fondness, they would tramp the
woods, they would row on the lake, and
they would: ‘

“Say"—Anne came back to the pres-
ent with a thud—*how long are you
going to keep a fellow in this coop?”

Anne didn't know what to say. She
was somewhat provoked herself, for it
was now long past noon and it was hot
and, moreover, she was very thirsty.

She felt and looked as If she wanted
to cry and the lunatic sald apologetical-
ly, “I hope you'll forgive my rudeness,
but I'm telling the truth, honestly,
and—"

But Anne did not hear him, for she
had just spled the old mail carrier rid-
ing by and in another moment Anne
was pouring out her tale, . “Oh, Mr.
Johnson, I've got the lunatic here, and
the gun is so heavy and—"

“Lunatic!” thundered the prisoner.
“So that's what you think I am?”

“Lunatic!” ejaculated the old man.
“Why, that's Jim Burroughs, who's
bought the old Fendergast place down
{n the village. The lunatic was caught
this morning, plumb tuckered out and |
In some clothes he'd evidently bore

Anne stared, then she flushed to the
roots of her hair. “Oh, please try to
forgive me. I didn't know-and I tried |
to belleve you weren't the lunatic, hons |
estly I didgbut—=" I

“Don't worry,” replied the erstwhile
lunatic. “I really didn’t mind belng
pisoner, under the circumstances.”

Thus comforted, Anné questioned:
“Wouldn't you llke to come out some
day and get acquainted with me, minus
the gun?”

Jim, Burroughs thought that he
would, but at present-he thought it ad-
visable to shed the girments so kindly
(7) left him by his assailant, and. so
with a gay smile and a promise to
come again he drove off with the mail
carrier. oo”

The next day he made good his prom
se, nnd 500n Anne's dream was
fulfilled, for they mm they formed a
mutual foridness, theyNJoanmeds'the
woods, they rowed on the Ygke, and as
all good stories should end—they mare
ried and lived happily ever after,

“Ned, come up quick. There's a
great flock of seabirds €lrelln’ ‘round

farmer, #who cares about birds? I'd
rather gee a flock of corn cribs than
anything else just now.”
