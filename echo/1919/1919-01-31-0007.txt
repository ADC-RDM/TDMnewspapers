To Ensure Strong and Healthy Foals,
Pregnant Mares Must Be Given
Exercise, Be Properly Fed and
Have Careful Stable Attendance,

(ontribited by Ontario Department of
Agriculture, Toronto.)

CETYLENE lighting is not by
any means a new thing In
this country as there are
homes here and there in vil-

lage and countryside in which this
system of lightning has been in use
for many years, Many improveménts
have been made in the mechanism of
the plant, so that now this system
i8 considered to be absolutely safe
and reliable If it receives reasonable
care and attention. Thecost, of course,
i8 rather more since the war, but
even at the present price it is an in-
vestment that will return high divj-
dends, probably not always directly
in dollars and cents, but in better
health, more comfort, less labor and
genuine satisfaction for those lyin
in the home, because acetylene gas in
burning produces less heat, consumes
less oxygen and forms less carbon
dioxide than kerosene, for example,
and makes a far more brilliant light
than even electricity, and it is easier
on the eyes. It may also be
used for cooking in the house and It

is also well adapted for street light-
ing of villages and small towns,

The acetylene lighting plant con-
sists of a gns generator, gas service
piping, and gas jets or -chandellers.
The generators vary in size accord-
ing to amount of gas required, one
for the home being, of course, much
smaller than that required for a lirge
institution or village. The chief
parts of the generator are: Water
chamber, carbide holder, gas holder,
gas filter, gas washer, gas intake
pipe, feed pipe, saféty vent, sludge
agitator and automatic carbide feeder
device, The generator for a home
requires only a few square feet of
space, as it is very compactly ¢on-
structed. It is usually placed in the
basement, and {t is very important
that it be kept safe from frost.

The operation of the plant is as
follows: The chemical substance used
for making the’ gas {8 caleium car-
bide, the game material that is used
in bicycle lamps, for instance Auto-
matically this chemical is fed into

Winter Care of Pregsant Mares,

Those who have had experience In
horse breeding have noticed “that a
ronsiderable percentage of the spring
colts, Jespecinlly those borm before
the mares are on pasturd, are weakly,
often not able to stand, and. sonié-
times without sufficient ambition to
purse when held up and the teat in-
traduced into the mouth. It will also
be observed that foals of this de-
scription are usually those of dams
that bave been pampered during the
winter months—those that hav~ been
well fed, and kept in the stable most
of the time without exercise.

The pregnant mare should be well

fed and given regular exercise or

light work, ‘The Idea that she should
not be wéll fed is not uncommon.
The foetus is daily Increasing in size.
This growth dees not take place
without nutriment.’ The nutriment
must be supplied by the blood of the
dam, and; ds nutriiient i8 not a nox-
mal product of the blood, but Is sup-
plied by the food thi¢ animal eats, we
can readily’ gee that the pregnant

  
    

   
     
     
    
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
    
 
  
  
   

    
    

ing foetus, which, in the later

mare requires®moye food than her

and oats are the foods to be relied
upun to: provide nourichment, and
these should be fed In quantities.

A pregnant mare should, where

TOBACCO SEED GERMINATION
TESTS.

 
 
 
  
       

 

For the past Ltwe years germination
tests have been run with the seed for
the various varieties grown at the
are folded over and the corners are
and’ the Harrow Tobacco Station, Har-
row, Ontario.

The tests In all cases were run in

duplicate on blue blotting paper some-
what heavier than the ordinary blot-
ting paper, The paper is cut Into
234" squares afier which the edges
clips. This makes a small tray which
folded down and: held with paper
clips. This make sa small tray which
accommodates 100 tobacco seeds quite
nicely. Since tobacco seeds are so
very small and the surface of the seed
coat somewhat rough or pitted. they
can best be counted op glass which is
placed over a sheet of white paper,
with a plece of small wire or forceps
with curved points. The seed on the
smooth surface of the glass can be
readily counted into .lots of 100 gach.
The 100 seeds can be easily transfer
red with a small camel's hair brush
from the glass to a plece of folded
paper which affords a ready means of
an even distribution on the germin-
otionitray. The trays are tien placed
on shallow pans which contain about
1" of rather fine sand (ordinary
building sand 18 very good) previous-
ly mofstened. Care, should be taken
not fo have the sand too wet. The
pans which accommodate 24 trays, 12
tests in duplicate, are then placed
into an incubator .at a temperature of
24 degrees Centigrade or 75 degrees
Farenheit. At the end of the 6th and
14th days the counts are made and 4n
most instances the test {8 concluded |
at this ‘date. In some instances the
seed are retained until the count on
the 21st day, but those that do not
germinate~by the 6th and 14th days
are of practically no value. The re-
sults of past tests show that in many
cages where the seed Is good a very
vigorous. germination will take plage
in 6 days and the test even concluded
on that date. Still with the seed from
gome varieties the maximum germin-
ation is not reached until the 10th and
14th days.

The germinative ability or viability
of tobacco seed, like that from many
other plants, varies a great deal, much
depending on the favorability of the
season while growing. No doubt a
great denl depends on the kind of
weather at the time the polination of
the pistils of the flowers. It the
weather is warm and favorable a much
higher percentage of viable seed are
set in the seed pods than under ad-
verse circumstances, an average of
60 tests with both 1916 and 1917 seed
gave an average germination percent-
age of 78,3 and 56.2 respectively. Very
few germination tests have been run
on the 1918 seed but the percentage
seems to be’ very little better than the

SPRAYING TOBACCO g
FOR THE HORN WORM

 

Spraying tobacco with either arsen-
ate of lend or Paris green is the most
leffective and economical method for
controlling the horn worm. By spray-
ing not o are all worms, on the to-
bacco killed but also all that hatch
within a week or ten days after spray-
Ing.

For this purpose arsenate of lead
has been found to be superior to Paris
green in that there {§ more danger of
burning the tobacco with the latter;
the Paris green washes off more read-
[ly andl therefore its period of effact-
iveness is shorter; and. too, if it is
necessary to spray several times, the <¥
Paris green seems to collect at a point 3
where the leaf jolns the stalk, killing
the Jeaf tissue and either causing the
leaves to drop off in the field or.to .
break offymore easily when harvesting. 3

‘Arsenate of lead may be used either
In the form of a paste or a powder,
and may be applied either in solution
or dusted on the tobacco, If used in 1
the paste form twice the quantity re- = -
