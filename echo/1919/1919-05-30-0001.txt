hour next morning. The hall was very
tastefully decorated for the occasion.

—Under the direction of county of-
ficlals the front rond from Petrimoulx's
!Corners to Amherstburg has been put
in" first-class shape, and is preatly en-
joyed by motorists. Parts of this road
have been so bad for a month that
there has bean very little traffic that
way, moat of the automobiles taking
the third concession and Malden Road
to Windsor. The town's portion of
the “Pike” has also been rounded up
and barring a couple of rough spots
is In good condition. Ag it is now
thoroughly drained It %s not likely
ever again to become the eyesore it
has begn since spring.

—As the evening wag so fine and
people were holidaying, the attendance
at the baseball concert and dance in
the town hall, :Monday night, was not
large. E. J. Gott occupied the chair

augmrs well for their record this sea-
son. As soon as, the game wds sewed
Wp. Brush was given a rest. and. «Mos
Gibhon, of the Bank of Cammerce, and
Andrew Bellecoure, two of the reserve
Ipitchers, were sent in“for a couple of
innings each and displayed premise of
some fing, work , later on. Hveratt |,
IBertrafd relieved Jack Hamiflton: be-
hind the bat for a few Mnings, letting
nothing get by. If, Monday's game is
a sample of what the home: team will
do when on cirenit, they are pepnant
winners from thedstirt. The ¢lub was
delighted with a voluntary collection
of $110, a true test of the interest Am-
‘herstburg citizens take in the Ir home
team.

Amherstburg, Ont.,
May 27th, 1919.

The Editor of The Echo;—

May I kindly ask what is tHe reason
why we hadn't a flag on the town hall
or the Public school Monday. It looks’
to mie as though the town might be
ashamed of the old flag, as no flag
was flying on these buildings last No-
vember when the great armistice was
signed. Hywever, I'm sure no one
could have any just reason for being
ashamed G¢ our flag. I've been in, the
town 3 Erdat many years and I néver
remember the town hall not having a
flag before I asked several citizens.
what wag (he reason for this neglect,
but -they conjdn't give a satistactory

answer. By aj) means keep the old
flag flying, y : »
