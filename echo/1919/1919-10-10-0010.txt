The Navy Leag ue of Canada :
A Its Vital Work for Canada *

THE Navy League of Can-
ada fosters the splendid
spirit that made the British
the greatest of maritime na-
tions. It organizes loyal Can-
adians so that practical work
may be accomplished for the
development of - Canada’s
direct interests at sea.

The human side of Canada’s Mercan-

tile Marine is the League's especial
interest—training Canadian boys to become the stur-

“dy type of British manhood that won its laurels
again and again in the great war—relieving distress
among victims of the submarine warfare—and giv-
ing the sailor ashore an alternztive place for rest and
recreation to the places of doubtful entertaininent
that abound in port. .

- Why the $500,000 is needed

On Nelson Day, October 21st, starts a 3-day

campaign throughout the Dominion to raise

+ $500,000 necessary to finance the coming

ear’s work of the Navy League of Canada.

elp the work by giving liberally. As a na-

_ tion whose expanding trade will depend on

exports, we must educate our boys to the

highest type of seamanship so that they will

be equipped to man our ships to carry our
exports to foreign markets.

You will do! your part in this work by con-
tributing liberally to the support of the Boy's
Navy Brigades, the organizations by which
the Navy League trains boys for our mer-
chant marine.
