18 IT FRUIT OR VEGETABLE?

re
Renewnl of the Everlasting Question
Concerning the Tomato,

The season has arrived, as some-
body reminds us, for the annual con-
troversy as to whether the tomato
is, a vegetable or a fruit. We fmag-
ine that vegetarians and fruitarians
become cspeciully heated over this
prgblem, and that many an exciting
“debate ‘occurs whenever representa=

tives of these two opposing cults

come Into juxtaposition,

Speaking from a broad but shal-
low ! garden experience, Wo should
says that this question does not really
become a problem until the fruit or
vogotable or whatever It is comes to
the table. In the {ntermediate stago
of its urban experiences, that Is to
say In the markets, we find the to-
mato treated with all the exalted
consideration that is bestowed upon
the choicest fruits. It {s put up in
small baskets, like strgwberries or
hot-house peaches, and invested
with an afr of quiet elegance that
commands great respect. It these
chaste and delicate conditions falled
sufficiently to inform the curious
consumer, the price afMxed {8 quite
enough to determine the matter.
The price declares plainly that the
tomato is a fhuit.

However, prices are not altogether
conclusive in these days: It is dif-
cult under modern conditions to de-
termine the status of anything on
this basis. There are various pro=
ducts of which the botanical status
could hardly be decided by the com=
mercial evidence. There are cucums=
bers, for example. By the price one
might be justified in assuming that
a cucumber was some species of m=
ported melon. Structurally, too, for
that matter, perhaps it might be ar=
gued that a cucumber is more like a
melon than it is like anything else.
Anyway, it has certain features that
make it more fruit-like than Vege-
table-l1ike, And certainly the price,
early in the season, approximates
that of grapefruit.

It would seem plain enough that
the tomato is not only the only
article capable of providing a con-
{roversy. as to whether it 18 fruit or
vegetable, We know how we think
of it when {t is in the market and
classed with early peaches in the
matter of.price, and we Know also
how the marketmen treat it, very
tenderly, as they would any fruit.
You never see tomatoes 1ying around
carelessly, a8 you often see potatoes,
parsnips, summer squash, cauliflower
and even most of the Asparagus.
The people of the market treat a
tomato delicately, 4

Their attitude is due in a great
measure, of course, to ordinaryJpru=
dence, A tomato that is treated
roughly or disrespectfully 18 quite
likely to retaliate. It {8 an exceed-
fhgly boomerangy objgct, and if its
blushing delicacy is offended it has

a way of distributing itself over the | em

contiguous landscape In an altogether
disconcerting way. = The effective
radius of a bursting tomato 8 often
surprising, and the effects are noted
for their high visibility. Marketmen
are uot inclined to take hazardous
chanees,

And apparently ‘ the” growers of
{omdtoes are equally indifferent: The
question, it seems, does not become
a controversial problem until the
tomato reaches the consumer. Then,
as frequently manifested, there is a
tormenting uncertainty as to: whioth-
er the tomatoels fruit or vegetable.
Porsonally, we have alwnys been in-
clined to split the credit Afty-firey,

SED SIDER, SN
Alpaca From Waste.

My, (lato Sto Titus) Salt, who hodd
begn for some Years connected, with
the woollen manufacture, happened
one day. In 1538 to notice in Livers
pool gome three or four hundred
sacks of alpaca wool that had been
fmported from time to time fron:
South: Amerieay ip the hope of -find-
ing & planufacturer who might buy
themafor some purpose. Several meh
had tried to work up this new Dia~-
terial, but without success: 80 thero
it*lny for years, no one seening lo
want it, until Mr. Salt came acrosi
it, and after a number of trials, in
which he modified his wool machine
ery Lo suit’it, adapting’ it afresh and
ovorcoming nmeny obslatles, he fin-
ally solved the problem .by adopting
cotton WALDS, and soan after put. oa
the market a new material, alpaca,
a soft, glosay, elegant fabric, which
3D» took the fancy of the publie
that, in some fiteen ycars, Mr. Salt
amassed am onormous  fortung,
which “thus enabled him to carry OL
tlie gueat philanthrophical work
vshich, made him famous.

. Prevent Bi Loss of Grain.
=" yaddr dyerage conditions the loss
of grain during harvest is far greater
than ls generally supposed “by he
average farmer. Poor worl on the
part of the binder, shattering during
shocking and jixutine faulty work
of the separator, und inor losses at
the machina result ing waste of mil-
lions of bushels every. yent. With a
guaranteed: price every farmer is of-
fered mn incentive to reduce such
losses to a minimum this season. See
that the binder is in good working
order, handle the bundles carefully,
puing a tight floor or canvas on the
wagon In hauling, and a ddmand by
the fagmer th the'separator do effi-
clont work will’ sava many dollars’
worth of grain as well as add to the
-pocketbook of tho farmer. © ’
