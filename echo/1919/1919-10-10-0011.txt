Woe give thee thanks, O Lord,
Not for armed legions marching in their

might,’ ’
Not fer the glory of the well earned
fight

Where brave men slay their brothers, |.
also brave,
But for the millions of thy sons who
work J
And do thy tasks’ with joy and never
_ shirk )
And doem the idle man a burdened
slave.

For these, O Lord, our thanks!

We give thee thanks, O Lord,
Not for the turrets of our mon-of-war,
The monstrous guns and deadly steel
they pour :
To crush our foes and make them
+ bow the knee,
But for the homely sailors of thy deep,
The tireless fisher folk who banish sleep
And lure a living from the miser sea.
For these, O Lord, our thanks!

And all the arrogance of pomp and

LEN

But for the pioneers who plow the field,

Make deserts blossom and the moun-
tain yield

ts hidden treasures for man's daily

need.
For these, O Lord, our thanks!

~ We give thee thanks, O Lord,
Not for the palaces that wealth has

grown,
Whero ease is worshiped, duty dimly

¥ known
And Pleasure leads her dance the

flowery way, 2
But for the quiet homes where love is

queen
And life is more than baubles, touched

and seen, J
And old folks bless us and dear chil

dren play.
For these, O Lord, our thanks!
