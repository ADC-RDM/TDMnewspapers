Haven't you and your wife often talked about “Buy-

ing a Home?” Well,"it can be done. It rests entirely with
you. ’

ohooiecholrfeeferforfefeofertesde

The first thing is to come in and start.a Bank Account.
Then regularly add as much as you can spare. Keep this’

up and it won't be long until you can buy that home, and
you can buy it cheaper for cash.
