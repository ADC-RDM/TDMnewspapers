Saving requires self-denial; so the habit of saving |

; strengthens the character, while benefiting the finan- tH

cin] and social standing.

Savings grow quickly. Instead of buying useless
{hings, deposit. your savings in the Molsons Bank, and [1
coe how quickly thep grow. Note also the satisfaction ||
and independence which a balance at the Molsons ™

Bank gives.
