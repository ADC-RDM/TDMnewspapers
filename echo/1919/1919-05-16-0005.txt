and the lands which lie.adjacent to
it. We always thought that British
justice stood for equal rights to all
and special privileges to none, but this
expression on “the part of the sand-
suckers has got the Kajser backed off
of the stage. We have given up in.

land to came to our assistance, but,
dear E@% we have looked in vain. We

purpose. There Is an undercurrent
