glad tidings flashed across the world, there followed with the Nation's

. Prayer of Thanksgiving, one yearning query,
of wives, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts.
“How soon will our boy be home?” “And, from France and Flanders,
from Italy and Egypt, ‘from Palestine and from far-off Siberia, there came an

answering echo, “ How soon, how soon, may we go home?”

How 1s the sudden trust Londoners
have come to exhibit for each other
to be accounted for? There Is an ex-
treme shortage of copper coins for
small change in London, and one man
says of his experiences: “On several
occasions lately news vendors who
have been unable to change silver have
said to me, ‘Never mind, pay me the
next time you are this way.! Only
one of them knew me as a regular cus-
tomer. Even more unexpected credit
than this was offered me at a rallway
booking office where I tondered a shill-
Ing for a two-penny fare. ‘Hm short
of coppers,’ sald the girl booking clerk,
‘pay me tomorrow.” ‘But I shall not be
here tomorrow,” I replied. ‘Then pay
me the next time you are here, when-
ever it is,’ she sald. ‘But supposing I
forget, 1 expostulated. “Oh, I know
that you will\come and pay me some
day, she answered. ‘I've never known

fered by others, who tell of copper

and oftem very poor and humble stran-
gers.—London Mail.

 

Clearing Up After War.

On the banks of the Thames, less
than twenty miles from London, there
fs an American town of the mush-
room kind such as'you might find in
a new California oll field. Its popu-
lation consists of mere than 200

white men and about 150 negroes. It
covers twenty-five acres which nine

months ago were fallow grass. land.
The business of the town is to re-
celve, sort and store war material.

Warmth Increases OIll Flow. he
An electrical method of carrying
warmth to the bottom of oll wells has
been found in many cases greatly to In-
crease the flow of oll. The heating
process, says Popular Mechanics Magn-
zine, decreases the viscldity of the oll,
usually occasioned by the admission
of alr to the well and the cooling of the
rock bed. Minute creviees and capil
lary channels which afford easy pass-
age to warm, thin ofl become quite {m-
passable If the oll gums. The electric
heating method not only thins the oll.
hut often generates gas whose pressure
helps the oll to the surface. The sys-
tén found military use in the aban-
doned oll flelds of Roumania and

Galicia. ?
