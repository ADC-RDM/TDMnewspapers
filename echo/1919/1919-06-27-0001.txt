RIVER FRONT ROAD IN IT,

 

Approved by ' Highways | Department
as County Provincial Road,

 

At last the agitation that has been
followed up over o period of vears, to
have the front road between Offbway
and Amhersthurg, placed in {ue Coun-
ty scheme of Good Roads and the later
proposal to the Government to make.
this a County Provincial road, and on
down to Ruthven by way of: Harrow
and Kingsville, has been successful.

In reply to a resolution adopted at
the spring session of the {ounty Coun-
ofl, asking that the Government ap-
[prove this route for a County
highway, the following telegram was
recaived Friday from 'W. A. McLean,
Deputy Minister at Highways in the
Provincial Government: +
To Wm. Woollatt,

clo J. F. MiHen,
County Treasurer.

As requested by Colinty Council; can
approve the Provinofal County High-
way designation for good roads. {rom
Ruthven to Amherstburg and the
front road to Ojibway; also the Te-
cumseh road and the Base Line to the
Kent boundary. :

W; A. McLEAN,

This {8 the best news for the whole
district, as under thig system the Gov-
| ernment will pay 60% And the County
40% of the construction, besides the
| road will have to conform to the speci-
fications laid down by the Provingjal
Department and wil no doubt be one
of the first pieces of work undertaken
by the County. There is some differ-
ences of opinion as to what route
the three municipalities—Amherst-
burg through Malden, ‘as some dis-
satisfaction has arisen in Malden with
the roads designated in the County
system at the last - session of the
County Councllsand representatives of
three munycipadities—Amherst-
burg, Anderdon and Malden, together
with the County Roads Committee,
have been called to meet at Amherst-
burg next Monday afternoon at 2.16
o'clock to go over the roads designated
and ‘hear representations and-make
such recommendations as are neces.
gary in this matter.

Celebrated In Amherstburg.

 

As this is the 76ta anniversary of
St. John the Baptist church and 50th
ammiversary of the St. John Baptist |:
Society, {t was very fitting that the
annual celebration of St.’ John the
Baptist Soclety of Essex County
should be held at Amherstburg this
year. and the day being warm and
bright, a large crowd gathered here
Tuesday. The presence of His Lord-
ship Bishop Fallon lent luster to the
occasion and drew devout worshippers
from all parts of the parish to the
Solemn High Mass, which wns cele-
brated by Fr. Burns; . Space this week
will not permit a detailed account of
this {mportant religious function. Fol-
lowing the service, the procession
formed, headed by the Essex Fusiliers
band, and over 100 members of St.
John Baptiste Society followed by His’
Lordship and a dozen priests and
many citizens in an automobile par-
ade to the town park, where they
dispersed and partook of one of the
most elaborate dinners ever enjoyed
at a picnic in Amherstburg, splendidly
served fn the Agricul*ural building by
the ladies of the church... , Oven six
hundred partook of dinner and supper.
The place was nicely decorated for
the occasion and was most inviting.
His Lordship and the clergy occupied
a special table prepared in-their honor,

The committee then ran off a list
of sports, the winners of which were:
100 yards dash—F. McGibbon, F, Spry.
Boys 100-yard dash, under 16—John
McBride: Ivan Beaudoin. Girls’ dash,
16 and .under—Sopha Waxman, Mar-
garet Droulllardsy Fat man's race—Mr.
Lefontaine, of Windsor; E. Gott. Boys’
shoe race—Denis Gerard, Wni. Frank-
line Tug-of-war, Anderdon vs. Malden,
won easily by the former. =
