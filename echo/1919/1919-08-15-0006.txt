We Are As Full of Deadly
Poisons As A Germ
Laboratory.

AUTO - INTOXICATION
OR SELF- POISONING

“FRUIT-A-TIVES” Absolutely Pre-
vents This Dangerous Condition.

The chief cause of poor health is
our neglect of the bowels. Waste
matter, instead of passing from the
lower intestine regularly every day,
is allowed to remain there, generating
poisons which are absorbed by the
blood.

In other words, a person who is
habitually constipated, is poisoning
himself. We know now that Au/o-
inloxicalion, due to non-action of the
bowels, is directly responsible for
serious Kidney and Bladder Troubles;
that it upsets the Stomach, causes
Indigestion, Loss of Appetite and
Sleeplessness; that chronic Rheum-
atism, Gout, Pain In The Back, are
relieved as soon as the bowels become
regular; and that Pimples, Rashes,
Eczema and other Skin Affections
disappear when “Fruit-a-tives” aro
taken to correct Constipation.

CFruit-a-tives” will protect you
against Auto-intoxication because
this wonderful fruit medicine acts
direétly on all the eliminating organs.

FOREST FIRES DRAIN

One of the most destructive forest
Tire seasons in recent years Is taking
a tremendous toll of Canadian national
wealth. With the exception of a small
area in northern Ontario, practically
all the fires cleaned off the timber crops
on lands that'are useless for agricul-
ture. Such lands can grow only one
crop and that is wood. Once stripped
these areas lie profitless for half a
century or more, Repeated. fires,
usurlly kill reproduction for all time
to come and another” section of bar-
rens is added to the nation's great
total.

— Contrary to public impression, ev-|

ery forest fire Is a direct blow at the
‘provincial or federal treasury, for the
