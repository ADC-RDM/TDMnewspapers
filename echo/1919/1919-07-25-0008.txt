THE

AMHERSTBURG ECHO.

If I knew you and you knew Ine, When'er we ship you by Inistake, y

"Tis seldom we would disagree; Or in your bill some error make, /

But never having yet clasped hands, From irritation you'd be free,

Both often fail to understand If T knew you and you knew me.

That each intends to do what's right, Or when the checks don't come on time,

[3

And treat each other “honor bright.” And customers send us nary a line,

How little to complain there'd be We'd wait without anxiety,

1f I knew you and you knew me, If I knew you and you knew me.

CARD OF THANKS.

Or when some goods you “fire back,” Then let no doubting thoughts abide

Or make a “kick” in this or that,
We'd take it in good part, you see,
If I knew you and you knew me.

Of firm good faith on either side;

Confidence to each other give

 

With customers thousands strong, Living ourselves, let others live.

Occasionally things go*wrong—
Sometimes our fault, sometimes theirs—

Forbearance would decrease all cares;
Kind friends, how pleasant things would be

But any time you come this way,

 

That you will call we hope and pray,
Then face to face we each shall see,

If I knew you and you knew me.
