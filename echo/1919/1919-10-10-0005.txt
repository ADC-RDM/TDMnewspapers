BEFORE buying Victory Bonds again you may want ‘to

year

know how Canada used the money you loaned her last

Canada borrowed the money to carry on the war and to pro-
vide credits for Great Britain and our Allies :

(CONSIDERABLY more than one-half of the Vi

Loan 1918 was spent on our soldiers
$312.900.000. for paying them feeding them. bringing them
home, separation allowances to their dependents. maintenance

of medical services and vocational training schools

$39.000.000 of the Victory Loan 1918 was
of authorized Soldiers’ gratuities

9.000.000 was spent at Halifax for relief and reconstruction
after the disaster

for Canada because cash purchases were impossible

They. have had the effect of tremendously helping “agricl- .
tural and industrial workers to tide over the. depression that
would have followed the Armistice, had we not made these

credit loans... ;

As far as money is concerned, 1919 has been, and is still—
“just as much a war year ;as 1918. Our main, expenditures
for war cannot be completed until well on. into 1920. Thus _
another Victory Loan is necessary—Gel ready to buy: 3
