regaled me with a harrowing tala of
pillage and murder. It was conveyed
to him, he snid, over the long-distance
telephone, by one of his line riders.

Jim declared that, Judging from the
man's choice of comparatively moder-
ate words, he must have gone to the
telephone’ booth before going to the
Orlentnl, to be refreshed with that par-
tleular brand which Its thrifty pro-
prietor Is wont to keep on tap for the
cowmen of the region, Thus he placed
some credence In the report.

He sald that some half-dozen sav-
| ages, drunk with temporary freedom,
and led by a half-breed more cunning
than his followers, were traveling in
this direction, avolding towns, hut
swooping down on isolated ranches,
ready to murder thelr occupants and
drive off thelr stock. Having heard
nothing from neighboring ‘sheriffs, I
took little stock In the story.

“Probably one harmless red-skin,
filled with firewater, strayed from the
reservation, and Is whooping things up
until somebody eorrals him,” I told my
deputles.

At any rate, because a show of offl-
cial Interest was desirable, I pronifsed
the old man to let him know if any-
thing happeneq®and I asked the boys
to stay around the office that night.

With that honest wish in my mind, I
left the place and started for the fringe
of trees which mark Bear Crek. As
for the man I wanted, I had never seen
him, but his reputation was familiar
to me.| Its burden was that, with all
bis black record, he had neither harm-
ed a woman nor fought unfairly.

Straight ahead, I saw the dark line
hugging the water, To the right, only
the endless plain; to the left, the same
thing. No, there was a light, away In
the distance In a spot where no light

Imagined that I could see the sinuous
movement of flery tongues. I con-
cluded that ome poor aettler's barn
was going up in smoke. Then I struck
spurs to my pony.

A minute later a fearful thought
gripped me. My own home. was due
west, right where that fire—but, my
God! It could not be!

I stared for an instant, ns If fas.
cinated. Then came action. The
fugitive and his crime were forgotten;
80 was the fact that I wore n sheriff's
shleld. 1 settled myself In the saddle,
the rowels bit deep and 1 was off like
the wind across gullies and sudden
arroyos, through hog-wallows, filled
with the powdery dust of seasons,
over. frencherous towns of prairie
dogs, whose fatal burrows - my peony
missed as If by instinet, stralght for
that baleful glow which seemed to
grow more distant with évery leap,

At length I clearly saw the flames
curling hungrily over the roof of my
burn. Then 1 saw the smoking ruins
of the shed,

I could henry the ronr of the fire. I
begnn to strain my eirs for some hy-
man sound—e¢ven cries or distress. 1
yelled to let them know I was com-
Ing, before I realized that I was too
far away to be heard over the din.

The next Instant a Sound reaclied
mie. Worse than the hiss of the flames
or the grouns of tortured timbers, this
hideous screnm almost froze my blood.

It was the yell of Indians, born of
(he blood lust. Easton's glib warning
fished through my mind.

While still within the fire's zone of
binckness, and just ontside of the
Hames’ glow, I jumped from my horse
and ran toward the douse. In the

forth such a Steady stream of hot lead

It seemed as If the man’s weapons

by a livid line of flame. As he shot,
he came closer to the house.

which my wife with outstretchéd WINDSOR

gentleness he lifted the child from his

while the Indians who could, ride were
making tracks for the hills. ‘

Five minutes later, my wife told
me, between sobs, how the little girk
had run to the smokehouse ‘for meat
for breakfast, and how, almost at the
same time, she had seen this stranger
ride uplout of the darkness; Then, as
if by magic, the Indians appeared.”

‘walked slowly toward us leading a
