The report was adopted.

Mowd by Mr, Brown saconded by
Mr. Dexike, that a warrant be drawn
on the Treasyrer in favor of B. D.
Plant for the 6% additional business
tax pald by Mr Plant. —Carried.

Mayor Park mggested that a resolu
tion he passed calling the County
Roads Superintendent's attention to
the need of serping the front road so
that it will noi be jmpassible this fall
and winter. There are two bad
bridges and saveral very bad holes
which require immediate attention.

Dr.: McBridz, F, B Laramie and
Reeve Brown also spoke on the same
matter,

Moved by Reeve Brown, gaconded
by Mr, Bertrand, tiat the Clerk be In-
structed to write Nr. Kunlster, Inform-
ing him of the cordition of the front
road, and that he look after the re-
pairs of this road - Carried. ;

Moved by Mr, Larami® goconded by
Dr. McBride, that ihe Board of Works
be empowered to have i crossing bullt
on Dalhousie street north.— Carried.

The matter of issuing a duplicate de-
benture to Mra. Heary Atkin to re
plage the one she clsims not to have
received was discussed. Mr. Laramid
made “a motion along the lines Bug-
gested by Mr, Cuddy. when Sollcitor

9 St

Davis said he had prepared a resolu- |
tion. > Mr. Denike didn’t see that it was &

necessary for this council to be ac-
cepting thelr resolutions from .the
sollcitor, and he moved , seconded by
Mr. McBride, that a duplicate daeben
ture be issued to Mrs, Atkin. with
coupons: marked duplicate, and -that
the Imperial Bank be asked to give a
security bon for the second one.—Car-
ried.

Mr. .Laramie—"We were to have a
report from the Police Committee.” -

Mr. Turner—"If you would look af-
ter your own committee, It would be
better for you."

This led to a pleasant [nterchange
of opinions between these two council:
lors regarding their respective duties,
which was amusing to the rest of the
council, but as the Mayor told them—
didn’t get anywhere,

It happened, however, that the C. O.
P. had collected only $46 dog tax and
killed 32 dogs, when he ran up against
a snag in the form of a citizen who
refled him to kill his dog. Then the
C. O. P. backed up and refuses to go
further unless his” authority receives
the backing of the council expressed
In a resolution.

This led to.a general discussion and
a postponement of the question until
the dog by-law is gone into.

Me, Turner wanted to know who wits
responsible for the piece of pavement
broken by the Brunner, Mond at the
toot of Willlam street when putting
in their pipe.

Reeve Brown, Mr. Laramie and Dr.
McBride all were of thé opinion that
the Brunner, Mond was responsible
for repairing this piece of pavement
as their workmen broke it when can-
necting up the water pipe.

Moved by.Mr: Denike,-saconded by
Mr. Brown, that the matter be left in
the hands of the Board of Works with
power to act.

Regarding the tenders for pavement,

Dewar, Manager of the Bell Telephone
Co,» had no objection to removing the
poles on Murray and Dalhousie streets
it the council intends to pave. but
couldn't promise to get the umterial
for underground construetion work
until next semper. ©

Mr. Bértrand suggested going ahead
with theéypavement, and the Bell Téle-
phone Co. would then have lo move,
and he moved that the tenders be
opened. a

Mr. Turner safd
for this pavement was dependent
moving these poles, TI Ko

Mr. Denike couldn't see that any in
terests are being injured by holding up
this work until thé Bell Telephone Co:
removes ts poles, and moved that the
tenders be not opened. “d

Moved by Dr, McBride, seconded by
Mr. Bertrand, that the tenders be
opened.

Mr, Laramie seconded Mr, Denike's
motion. i - ud

The amemiment was put and split 3
to 3—Messcrs. Brown, McBride and
Rertrind voting for the amendment.
Messrs. Denike, Laramie and Turner

Mr. Laramie called for the yeas and

Maved by Messrs. Denfke and Tur-
ner, that the Bell Telephone €o. be
