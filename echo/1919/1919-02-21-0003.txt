Katherine frowned with displeasure
as she turned to the first story In the
magazine the postman had just
browght. The story with her own

the tith bad been illustrated as she
had fered by Jullan Fletcher, and,
Julian Retcher had managed to spoil
the last 101f dozen or 80 of her eontri-
butions ¢ the National.

Other pople raved about his work,
and did ot stop to Insist upon the
fuet, as dil the author, that an {llus-
tration shoild stick to the context.
When a git is sald to come down a
sairway In 4 queenly gown of velvet

the Illustration a debonair lass tripping

Sense of humor that compelled one who
guzed to smile back In answering sym- |

Just now the Indy represented in the
pleture was supposed to be a haughty
person who prided herself on her
knowledge of clothes. Also she was
supposed to bé alighting from her
limousine and drawing back in startled

“If,” sald Katherine,~ “that man

She looked again into the eyes of the

In spite of herself she smiled back.
Then happening to look up into her
own mirror, she was startled, Her own
eyes looking back at her ‘from the
glass were the exact counterpart of
those on the page. And her hair, wavy
and caught back loosely from her face,
with its part on one side, was éxactly
like that of. the girl in the picture.
Then she caught up another picture,
and another, and studied them, long
and carefully. Then she took another
inventory of herself.

Slowly the bright color mounted to
her cheeks, and her breath came hard.
The pictures In the magazine “were of
her, there wasn't a doubt of it. And
now It came back to her gradually that
she had heard people say they had no-
.ticed a resemblance. And the dress In
the stairway picture wos certainly

MAKE DOGS POPULAR,

 

less Sort of Aninml,
The dog question, which has given
rise to so mucn discussion of Inte,

cative effort just as has the matter
of Improving live stock of all kinda,
though it must be admitted that leg-

islation ‘hus been brought Into force
in the matter of Improving our
breeds of horses in, this country with
good effect, and probably somewhat
similar legislation would apply ‘hene-
ficlally In the case of dogs, One can
hardly help coming to conclusion
that most of the defenders of the
dog and his right to existence are
ndmirers, of good dogs as” well as
lovers of dogs in general, and that
even the person who is chiefly inter
ested in standing up for some parti-
cular cross-bred dog or cur would be
well satisfied to replace the animal,
should ft cease to exist, with one
that Is well bred and a good Indi-
vidual as dogs go, in the opinion of
the judges.

No doubt, the greatest benefit to
the canine race Is being accomplished
by those dog fanciers, who are mem-
bers of the kennel clubs and, almost
In every case, interested in bench
and fleld shows, © Such persons, . ba-
side being sentimentally inclined fin
favor of the dog have a proper con-
eeption of what a dog of any breed
really should be, and it is to these
persons that ft should be left to de-
cide the fite of the kind of doi that
is a general or particular nuisance,
As a matter of fact, they have al-
ready decided the question and are
moving as rapidly as possible in the
right direction by encouraging the
breeding of good dogs such as will be
of such intrinsic value that thelr pro-
per care and management will be
assured.

“A place for everything and every-
thing in its place” applies to dogn
most particularly, and the majority
of owners of good dogs are the first
to admit this. The keeping and breed-
ing of good dogs (purebreds) should
be encouraged more strongly than at
present, if anything, The cur may he
a good dog in some senso but his
reproduction shéuld not be encour-
aged because, without any record of

opinion of what his offspring is go-

justice™o the owner to remove his
bet cur by any means'whatever, go
long as the animal 48 kept within
reasonable bounds, but with the na-
tural demise of the particular speci-
men his family should cease to exist.

A Useful Bulletin.

A"most comprehensive bulletin on
| bacteria is that prepared by D. H.
| Jones B.S.A., and published recently
by the Ontario Department of Agri-
culture. The treatise includes # defl-
nition of bacterin in general, giving
jon idea of the average size of the
more common species and the four
! typical shapes in which the miscro-
scopic forms of life appear. Methods
of bacterial growth, multiplication
| and°moyement are described, and the
many specles of bacteria, both bene-
ficial and. harmful, are grouped and
discussed under. the following heads:
| Bacteria of. the Soil and Manure Plle,
Water Supply, Food Preservation,
Sewage Disposal, Milk and Milk Pro-
duets, Infectious Diseases of*Man and
Animals, Diseases. of Plants. In his
yintroduction to the discussion of the
subjeét under the above heads the
author says: "In addition to .those
bacterin which cause disease being
injurious, there are some which are
beneficial in one place but injurious
in" another. .- For instance, many of
"the species of ‘bacteria beneficial in
the soil are injurious when they get
onto food material, a8 they bring
about the decay: of putrefaction of
the food, rendering it unfit for use
if they are allowed to develop and
multiply on it or in it.” For this
reason, he explains, the title of the
bulletin, “Bacteria: Friends and
Foes,'":is adopted. Exact and ample
| illustrations aid. the reader in under-
standing the text. Thé bulletin’ is is-

Proper Care Given Manure. +

The time is approaching when
much. ofthe stock will be képt in
barns and sheds more or less of the

to’ take care’ of all manure that ac-
‘cumulates during the housing season.
Too often manure {s-pitched out of
the barns and exposed to the winter
rains. Where manure {8 leached in
this way the most valuable part of
the fertilizer copstituents is carried
away to the streams and lost to the
farm. When the manure 1s removed
from the stalls it should be placed
in a. covered shed or pit and packed
down“eo as to prevent leaching and
fire-fanging, or {t should be spread
upon the fields where it can be
ploughed in immediately or applied
