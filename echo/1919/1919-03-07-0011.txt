IN FALL MAKES

Fish Scraps. Are Excellent Where
They Can Be Procured, and
Alfalfa Hany, Soy Beans, Cowpens
and Oats Are Also Recommended
ns Feeds That Will Aid Develop-
ment, i :

Hog growers should provide home-
grown feed to supply protein — so
essentinl to the proper development
of hogs—and feed them in place of
shorts, middlings, tankage and ofl
meal, which are hard to gét and high
in price. Substitutes for these con-
wwmifirate feeds are found in crops
that are known to be rich In protein,
and we are advising the use of fish
meal, where {4 Is obtainable. Alfalfa
hay, soy beans, cowpeas and oats are
suggested as good substitute feeds.

Fish scrap, which has heretofore
been used as a fertilizer, has been
tried in hog*feeding experitents con-
ducted by the Department of Agri-
culture, and it has been found that
meal made from this material {s on
oa par with tankage when fed to hogs.
A number of state experiment sia-
tions are now conducting similan ex-
periments in feeding fish niedl to
hogs. Owing to the transportation
situationshowever, it i8 believed that
fish meal cannot be fed économically
in many parts of Canada.

Shortage of protein feeds can be
met with alfalfa hay in all localities
where it can be grown or obtained at
reasonable prices. There are two
ways in which this hay can be suc-
cessfully fed—in_small racks placed
in protected sheds where the hogs
may have freefncress to it, and by
grinding it and feeding It in self-
feeders or soaked in the form of
thick slop. The Department’s special
ists urge that hog growers provide
an ample supply of alfalfa. Usually
the last cutting of alfalfa {8 saved for
hog feeding, but for fear this cut
ting “cannot be harvested in good
condition, a sufficient amount of the
(second and subsequent cutting:
should be saved to supply enough
feed for hogs.

Rye sown in the fall makes good
pasture for hogs. As soon as itis
three or four inches high the hogs
can be turned in and left until snow
covers it up. Rye also provides good
pasture in early spring.

Soy beans are valuabitd to take the
place of other protein feeds usually
purchased. They make a very satis
factory feed when the beans are fed
threshed, or as hay, or when ground
as meal. Soy-bean hay, to be most
satisfactory, should be. cut early
enough to avoid the popping out of
the seeds. The leaves and the seed
both willl be readily eaten when
handled in this manner,

Dwarf Essex tape and oats can -al-
go be uséd successfully in the south
as a forage crop. Ejther can be seed-
ed from the last of August to the last
of September. Cottonseed meal can
be very successfully used in connec-
tion with corn a8 #4 hardening feed
for a period not to exceed thirty
days.

Farming In Australia.

Trade Commissiofier D. H. Ross,
at Melbourne, in an account of Aus-
tralin's ‘requireménts in the line of
agricultural machinery, points out
that a demand has arisen in that
country for lime spreaders to over-
come the sourkess of the soil caused
by the continued use of phosphates as
a fertilizer. The machines are chief-
ly in demand;inthe districts where
alfalfa is under cultivation., Further
in his report, which is pablished in
the Trade and Commerce Bulletin,
the commissioner says: “Despite the
fact that many bushels of wheat are
still held at Ausiialian ports through
lack of tonnage for {ransportation
overseas and that much of the labor
hitherto avallable to farmers ig now
on active service with the Aygtralian
Imperial Fortes abroad, the outlook
[oF the agricultural implement trade
for 1918-19 is held, by importers, (o
be distinctly encouraging.’

The above, together with ths jn-
formation that the Australian Gov-
ernment has made a beginning in the
ropatriation of Its soldiers by ad-
vancing to them money for the pus,
chase of horses, farming implements,
ete., goes’ to indicate that Australia

Bacterized Pept a Fizzle. |

A couple of years ago, it will be
recalled, sensitionnl announcements
were made as to the results obtained
by, an English: experimenter In the
use of bacterized peat as a fertilizer.
It was suggested that agriculture wus
about to be revolutionized, The
matter was immediafely taken up in
the Badteriological Department and a
test made In"1916 in the growing of
radishes. The test was far from
antisfactory, but was regarded. as in-
conclusive.” It was followed in 1917
by tests fn the growing of lettuce.
‘It was found that growth;is influ-
enced slightly possibly in the hasten-
ing of the'ripening process, but the
final conclusion Is reached that the
returns are not gommensurate with
tho -cost of treatment. It may be
added that similar adverse results
have been obtained from experiments
conducted on the subject of Rotham-
sted Station In England.—O0. A. Col-

The Dates to Plant for Heaviest

To Make Most Money From Wool
Shearing Must Be Done Properly
and Wool EHandled Carcfully—
A Few Hints Which Have Suved
Farmers Dollars.

(Contributed by Ontario Department of

Agriculture, Toronto.)

HERE Is a best time to sow
each class of farm drops to
gecuro the highest returns.
It is. difficult, however, to

know which are the most favorable

dates for the best returns of the dif-

The re-

sults of experiments conducted over

a series of years form a good gen-

eral guide. Some crops giye best re-

sults from later seedings. Seasons
vary so much that in some years the
grains are practically all sown by the
dates at which {t {8 only possible to
start sowing in other years. It is of
the utmost importance, however, to’
start cultivating the land as early as
it is dry enough to work to good ad-
vantage, The first cultivations should
take place for those. crops which
should be first sown. In this connec-
tion ‘it {8 interesting to study the re-
sults of an experiment which was

conducted in each of five years at
the Ontario Agricultural College.
Spring wheat, barley, oats and peas
were sown on each of six dates, One
week was allowed between each two
dates. The experiment was conduct-
ed in duplicate by sowing with the
grain drill and broadcast by hand in
each instance. The following table
gives the average results for the ten
tests In the five-year period:

It will be seen that the spring
wheat gives decidedly the best re-
turns from the first date of seeding.
There is not mu~h difference between
the first two seedings of barley and
oats, but there is a slight advantage
from the first date in“the case of bar-
ley and from the second date in the

lay as the season advanced of 27

These -esults are of special inter- I

tion.at this particular time.

Sheep Shearing.

Shearing and Tying the Fleece.—
Shearing should only be carried on
under the most favorable conditions;
upon bright, warm sunshiny days
when the sheep are dry of fleece and
the wool has “risen” somewhat from
we body. Cleanliness” and care in

e removal of all fleeces is very es-

sential and the Shearing floor should

be swept after each.fleece has been
removed and tied® This will elim=
inate a great deal of foreign matter
which, although it may atd weight,
does so at the expense of quality.
DunghLocks or Tags.—It will be
noticed with many fleeces, that there
are certain hard dung locks or tags
adhering to the britch .ends, These
contain a great deal of moisture and
if left on and rolled into the fleece
produce a damp heavy condition that
means a higher shrinkage and hence

‘Jess value) ‘They should, whenever

present, be snipped off with “the
shears before the sheep is shorn or
else pulledsoff by hand after the fleece
is spread out for rolling; They can
very easily be packed and shipped
geparately, bringing more money this
way than if left upon the fleece, The
same is true of all paint clotted locks
as well. : Ni

Rolling the Fleece.—Spread the
fleece out on the floor, being careful
not to'pull it apart.and with the flesh

side down. Then fold the belly wool |.

and both sides jn until your fleece ré-.
presents a strip about 18 inches wide.
Starting.at the tail end, roll tightly
toward the neck, thus leaving the
shoulder wool, which is always, the
superior portion, on the outside of
tHe roll. The grader always estimates
the grade .by the appearance and
quality of this Wool over the shoulder
end heart-girth, that over the hinds
snarters usually running a grade .or
tg lower. ‘

dying the Fleece—Having rolled
tiglty, tie both ways with the spe-
cia! paper twine supplied by the De-
PA%iment. Never under any consider-
atliy uge binder twine as the fibres
becuiie wiached to the wool and fol-
low tight through into the cloth
