re the memory of Sir Wilfrid Lau

{Hon Geo. P4Graham their nomination
; he wanted him in the House, and

Speaking of Union .Government and
thoge who supported it, Mr. Graham
declared {t.to be the wish of the new
leader. D. D. Mackenzie, as well as
of Sir Wilfrid, that all differences
which -had existed between Liberals
should be submerged in the great ge-
sire to apply to the reconstruction
period those principles of Liberalism
that had recreated Canada after 1886,
and which have been synonymous with
harmony and progress in every. coun-
try wherever applied: When the
earth trembled and the universe
rocked, men's minds changed not once
but many times, but the Liberalism
which we profess is sufficiently broad
to allow of consclentious differences
without political disturbance. The
speaker sald that the’ party form of
government was the best that had yet
heen devised for the protection of the
public. It provided for piercing scrut-
iny and unrelenting criticlem, and
