To Solve Canada’s Employment Problem

VERYONE in Canada should understand just what

the Government is doing to solve the unemployment
problems that may arise through tHe demobilization of

our fighting forces.

(2) Employment Offices.

So, that everyone—male or
female, soldier or civilian—can
get quickly such jobs as are
available the Ghvernment js co-
operating with the Provinees in
establishing a chain of Public
Employment Offices.  Employ-
ers are being urged touake ise
of these offices to. secure any
help they need. Farmers, for
example, who need hired. men
should « apply % the nearest
office. There will be a+ Public
Employment. Office in evopy
town of 10,000 people and
“wherever the need for one exists,
There will bie 69 different offices
in all —one-hall are already in
operation. 3

 

(2) “Lmployment Opportunities

ing, roadbuilding, railway work
