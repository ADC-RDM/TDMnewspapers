The Lloyd School of Scientific Beau-
tification housted imposing, two-coler
letter-hendS, bearing the picture of the
2-story Ramge building -and that of
a handsome lady In evening dress, la-
beled “Mme. Josephine Lloyd, presi-
Ident.”

The school, In reality, consisted of
one Harry Lloyd Rugglesford, one re-
[ bullt typewriter, one peroxidized six-a=
week stenographer, one second-hand
roll-top desk, and a small dingy
room on the top floor of the Ramge
bullding. The pictured bullding on
the statlonery was, therefore, n case
of metonomy, and that of the shoulder
show a gentle fake.

H. Lloyd Rugglesford was president,
secretary, treasurer, board of dlirect-
ors, and office boy of the school, along
with its faculty of able tenchers and
far-famed authorities on halr-dressing,
faclal massage, manicuring, and chi-
ropody, and kindred recherche, erudite
and recondite subjects.

His course of Instruction was by
correspondence. It comprised 12 les-
sons. The fee was $20-in-advance-
Jouspny-but-once-results-guaranteed.

He advertised In newspapers and
western magazines whose advertising
managers were not yet overwhelmed
by advertising reform.

When the heauty doctor's folloy-
up system was slow in convincing the
village belles that they should be sci-
antifically beautified, he made haste
to hold forth the lure of a special rate
of $15.42—$12.36—$0.18—8$7.20—88.05
—or $1.77.

He gauged his haste and figures by
| the quality of the stationery upon
which mademolselle . had propounded
her Inquiries. As a judge of human
nature—I mean feminine nature, for
there is a difference—by the station.
ery route, Harry Lloyd Rugglesfor:
was an adept,

The twelve printed lessons cost hiw
fourtéen cents. Advertising he figured
at fifteen cents an inquiry. Office rent
was seven dollars a month, The de-
preclation of the rebuilt and of the
P. B. stenographer were small. Over-
head expenses were less, Hence his
sound Judgment allowed him not In-
frequently to descend to the one dol-
lar and seventy-seven cents mark.

"Twas June.

How's that for a telescoped parn-
graph?

H.“Lloyd Rugglesford swung jaunt-
Illy off the trolley car, winked at the
man on the corner decorated with the
sign, “Please Help the Blind” re-

| celved an answering wink, paused at

the florist's.. purchased a 00-cent
bunch of violets, and was elevated to
the twelfth floor of the Ramge bulld-
Ing.
The -doctér of beauty entered the
beauty school with a satisfied air.
Sadle, the stenographer, was pound-
Ing out form letter No. 7: That same
epistle was calculated to plunge ‘the
fulr recipient into the seventh inferno
of despnir because she had not yet
purchased a money order and essayed
the route of scientific beautification. Ya
Form letter No, 7 wis a masterpiece
of selling talk on the sctentific elimi-
natlon of pimples, freckles, moles,
blotches; birthmarks, hair on the face,
{ingrown fingernails and the like.
“Hallo; Sade,” said the beauty doc-
tor. “I belleve you sald you liked vi-
olets. I've bought you a few.”
} He handed her his offering with a
truly Elizabethan bow. .

“Ever so much, Harry,” she snid

_gally, raising the bouquet to her pretty

retrousse nose. “I haven't saw as
swell n bunch as this all spring. You're
there with the keen eye for nifty flow-
ers, ‘all right. Them roges the other
dny'was too dear for-anything."

“Quit kidding, Sade,” sald the
beauty doctof, smiling archly. “You
know that nothing’s too good for you.
Anything much in the way of mall to-
day?” :

Sadie handed him a bundle of let-
ters. 1 3

An examination of thelr contents
disclosed 14 money orders, eight fes-
tive letters of warm commendation of
the course, 10 vigorous kieks from dis-
gruntled students, six threats to report
the institution to the post office au-
thorities if certain sums were not
forthwith returned, and 22 answers to
ddvertisements. \ hy

“Anything - startling, Harry?! {n-
quired Sadle, pausing in her clatter.

“Same old thing,” he rejoined.
“Kicks and kopeks galore, and 22 new
nibbles.”

“Well, ain't that just fine!” rejoined’
the private secretary, renewing her
mastication of the thiclg and. her at-
tack on the rebuilt.

. Harry returned to his morning's
‘mail, strove to translate the aspeet of

the 22 Inquiries ‘into terms of dollnrs
and cents, but his thoughts persisted
in drifting into other channels.
And this was the picture that floats
ed before his minds- :

It wns Sadle.

For weeks had this wonderful ple-
| ture hung in Harry's mind. Kor weeks
had he argued the question of mar-
riage pro and’ con. At times he had
been on the point of laying bare his
soul and begging Sandie to go with him
to the courthouse and clergy, and thus
make him the happlest beauty doetor
on earth, Wak 3

Yet, always, before he could seize
her fair hand and begin his matrimoni-
al canvass, a still small volca had
warned him that before he hitched
his chariot to a marriage Ilcense he
must needs address Satan In the terms
of the Biblical command, eschew hia
andignified and dangerous calling, and
cast about him for a more genteel and
desirnble voention.

He knew that already a post-office
Inspector was camping on his trail, and
he knew not the day nor tHe hour
when a cruel and untimely govern-
mental jolt would relegate the institu-
tion of scientific beautification into the
discard. Inocessantly had the sinister
vislon of the post-ofce Inspector been
haunting him, flitting Into his dream
by night, harassing his thoughts by
dny. 2

What—mnarry Sadie while standing
thus upon the thin Ice of his profes-
slonal life? No, It wouldn't be right
to commit such nu reckless act.

He had therefore cast about him for
a buyer upon whase shoulders to .un-
load the Institution of Intter-day
learning. And yesterday he had found
a man who .d offered him a thousand
dollars for the gay enterprise, for
ever to hnve. nnd to hold. He had ac-
cepted the offer, nnd closed the deal
with (mpatlent dispatch.

And now he had resolved to turn his
