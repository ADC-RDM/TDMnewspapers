EUROPEAAN CORN BORER

of the Department of Entomology at

all parfs of the plants.

“Hecause the moth fies the insects
Oh such a diversified range of hosts
fenders it a much more formidable
insect to control than if it confines ts

states Houser,

“Becouse’ the moth flies the insects

“At present there is no simple and

LUDENDORFF'S EXCUSES

Author of the German
Misfortanes,

Quartermaster-General Ludendorff
offers four reasons for Germany's de-
{ feat, These are: “The deficient
| strategyysof Gen. von Moltke; the de-
| tective direction of Gen, von Falken-
hayn; the poor information supplied
by the German Intelligence Service,
and, particularly, the inability of
Austria to help Germany on account
of the tenacity of the Italian army."

Ludendorff's analysis is incomplete
and superficial. Von Moltke originat-
ed nothing. His plan of campaign in
France in 1914 was an inheritance
from Count Schlieffen, his predeces-
Bor as chief of the German General
Staff. Von Moltke lost the Battle of
the Marne. But as a result of the
Marne campaign Germany secured
enormous military advantages, She
came into possession of Belgium and
the richest part of northern France,
For four years she suceeeded in shift-
ing the fighting on the West front
deep into enemy territory.

The Real

While von Falkenhayn was Chief”

of Staff Germany conquered Poland,
Courland, Lithuania, Serbia, Monte-
negro and Albania. She wrecked the
military power of Russia and set up
German Mitteleuropa, Von Falken-
hayn made a great error at Verdun,
yet haleft Germany in a more favor-
able situation than that in which he
found her when he took over the
High Commond.

Phe German Iatelligence Service
Was poor im a certaln senses, But
that was only because the. General
Staff insisted on Its furnishing in-
formatien which would delude the
Kaiser and the German public, If
the military leaders were deceived
it was only because they wanted to
decelve themselves. Thére was no bar

to an almost complete: knowledge of.

the political and military conditions
in all the enemy countries.
Austria-Hungary ‘ didn’t fall Ger-
many to any crippling extent. Least
of ‘all did she’ Mil on the Italian
front. The mountain barriers kept
Italy out of Austria. After Russia's
collapse Austria-Hungary could have
spared many. divisions for. German’
use on ‘the French front if Luden-
dorft had allowed her to remain on
the defensive in Venetia, N
Ludendorff evades the real ques-
tion of respomsibility for Germany's
dofeat. He came into power in the
winter months of 11917, taking auth-
ority out of von Hindenburg’s hands,
although the latter remained titular
Chief of Staff. sHe had to choose.be-
{wean ‘developing Germany's Suc-
oes9e8 in the east and turning west
again, conquering France and'.chal-
lenging the neutrals by running
amuok with the U-boats.. He fave,
the latter policy. Thus he made Gér-
man defeat {nevitable, Von Moltke's
and von Falkenhayn's mistakes were
trivial compared with his, . Ho was
the real author of Germany's military
misfortunes, :

WAR MEMORIALS. ~

Now that the war {8s over there is
a desireson the part of every munici-
pality to commemorate in some perm-
anent way the spirit of sacrifice that
sent so many of our best to France
and who now lie fn “Flanders Felds.”
This is as it should be, for too much
honof cannot be given to our brave
dead. The question then is as to the
form. the ‘memorials should take. Im
the old days, they took the form of
monuments or mausoleums, but since
a, new idealism has arisen through
this war {n® which our men have laid
down thelr lives such memorials are
meaningless. Could our glorious dead
but speak it would be to urge good
works 80’ that the lves of the living
may be-muade better for their sacri-
fice... Works such as hospitals, homes
of the aged, endowed beds, etc, do
(far greater honor than do monuments
and wo would urge the councils and
citizens of Canada to so construe the
meaning of memorials.

ESA Toronto lady recently reported a
conversation with her boys when she
directed their.attention to the. monu-
ment on University avenue, erected in
memory of soldiers who participated
in the South African. War. One of
the boys said: -

“After this blg war I bet we will
have a monument on every corner or
else one whopper.”

I told him we intended to honor vur
héroes by one “whopper.” It was to
be a memorial Hall, and would cost
many thousands. We would havo
concerts and lectures there.

“Well,” he answered, “I bot their
kids won't have the price of ticket."
