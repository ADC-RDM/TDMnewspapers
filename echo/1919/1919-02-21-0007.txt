REPORT OF THE SURBURBAN AREA ROAD COMMISSQNERS.

To the Warden and Members of Essex Codnty Council: —
Gentlemen,—During" the past year wo have not done eny
pullding except in the way of concrete culverts and a steel b
River on Road No. 8. And attached hereto you will find an {te
of construction and maintenance.

As many of the suburban roads are worn

permanent construction be started this year, and would Suggest that you
appropriate as much as you can for permanent Improvement winin the
suburban arény. Our. idea would be to continue a concrete road from Pllette
Corners In Sandwich Fast as far as possible, and we think that a stast should
algo be made on the Huron Line in Sandwich West, While we myat admit
that the rond known as the Gravel Rodd is possibly the main fond and needs

new construction, wo are In hopes that the Government will assume it as a
Provincial Highway, and thus relieve us, %

out, we would Suggest that

In conclusion we wish to make mention of the position of the City of
windsor with the County in reference to the payment for the muntenance
and construction of the roads in the Suburban’ Area. We are told by the
Clerk that he, as required, rendered to the City a bill for the work done (n
1916 and 1917, also a statement of the estimated amount required for 1918.
put the Treasurer tells up that up to date the City of Windsor had not pald
anything. < We would therefore suggest and recommend that the County
council take such steps as are necessary to collect from the CIty" of Windsor

the amounts due by the City to the County for the maintenance and construc-
tion“on the roads within the Suburban Area, E

Respeatfully submitted,
