Brighten Up and Beauly th e Ho

“TO MAKE GLAD THE HEART OF HOME”

Floor coverings of all kinds, especially rugs, have a Special and vital importance in brightening up the
home. The modern rug is made up with such a variety of pleasing and siriking patterns that even the most
fastidious peasons will find full scope for discriminating selection in making a purchase.

Choosing the right kind of a rug for the right kind of a room is a challenge to your artistic ability and
judgment. If you have cultivated a sense of the beautiful and know a good rug when you see it there

should be no difficulty in brightening the home with rugs.

You can make no mistake in picking out a Wilton rug, a strong favorite, but if you prefer Axminsters,
Brussels or Tapestry Rugs we can offer a collection in all the various sizes at a range of prices to suit you.
