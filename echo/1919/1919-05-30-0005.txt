FIRST PRINTING BY STEAM

Date in" November, 1814, Is One
Worthy of Remembrance by All
the Civilized World.

The 29th of November, 1814, forms
an Important date ‘In the history of
printing, and consequently in that of
civilization. It was the day on which
f newspaper was for the first time
printed by steam, instead of manual
power. The common printing press,
though much Improved during the sec-
ond half of the last century, could sel-
dom strike off more than 200 or 300
impressions per hour, with one man
to ink the type and another to work
the press. It was the enterprise of
the London Times that enabled invent-
ors to surmount the difficulties of ap-
plying steam to printing presses. In
1803, the edition of 8,000, which was
its dally. Issue, took many hours to
strike off. “Thomas Martyn, a ¢ompos-
itor 'on the ‘paper, produced a model
for n self-acting machine for work-
Ing the press, and John Walter, the
proprietor, supplied him: with money
to continue his labors.” The press-
men were hostile .to such innovation,
and Martyn was placed In fear of his
life, and as Walter, did not possess
large, capital, the scheme fell to the
ground.’ As his pecuniary means in-
creased, Walter encouraged invention.
Finally, tn 1814, the Koenig patent
was tried secretly for fear of thepress-
men, on the 20th of November, the
night on which. the machine was
brought Into use.” It was about six
"in the morning when Walter went into
the pressroom and astonished its oecu-
pants by telling ‘them that the Times
was already, printed by steam; if they
attempted: ‘violence there:was a force:
to suppress It; but If they were peace-
able their wages should be continued.
Thus was the most hazardous enter-
prise carried through and printing by.
steam given to the world.
