The firat public meeting at Amherst.
burg in connection with the Victory
Loan ‘campaign was held In the town
hall Friday night, but owing to the

the wenther wag inclement, the at-
tendance was not what { ould have
been considering the importance of
the occaslon,

The speakers and entertainers were
also delayed in getting to town by a
disarrangement of the electric railway
schedule, so any value the Kilty band
advertising might have been was lost.
However, what the meeting lacked in

have hotles, | and th suid E ecutof wil | numbers it made up In enthusiasm and
or the Asse wy part
thereof 10 Q0Y para: tay or Bi hose |PYmpathetic hearing, and. the repult

ecelved [WAS Most successful. *

F. W. Haas, chairman of the local
lommittee, occupied the chair and in-
troduced the program.

Mayor Park, on behalf of the town,
welcomed. the speakers and urged

ot those present to get behind our coun-

try because of the nedessity, and buy
Victory Bonds, because! they are a
good safe investment. '

The muscal part of -the program
was high class, The Kilty band, com-
posed of two Windsor pipers, paraded
the streets and. rendered “The Cock
of the North” {n the hall, Local duets
were sung by Capt. Fred. Lodge, an
old favorite in Amherstburg before the
war, and Vernon L. Hewer. late of
Grinnell Bros. and at the last Mr.
Hewer rendered a. solo. Miss Belle
Callnm also sang a very sweet solo,
being accompanied on the piano by
Miss Gladys Scratch,

The speakers of the evening were
W. E. Gundy, Major Tolmie and Alex-
ander Simmers, of Windsor.

Mr. Gundy aroused the Intercst of
the boys present by telling them that
the newsboys of Windsér to a man
had taken bonds.from $50 to $200,
paying down $5 and having the banks
finance the balance from their month-
ly savings. He handed out some excel-
lent advice to the lads, a number of |
whom were In the audience, on saving |
thelr first $50. Speaking to the grown. |
ups, he said that this district is bound
tobe one of the greatest industrial
centers on the North American con-
tinent, by the united efforfs of all of
us, we will ship the Industrial pro-
ducts from our own doors to the na-
tions of Europe, but ‘we can only
build up our export trade by assiting
ourselves by individual savings, and
then putting our united savings into
the treasury of Canada. In this way
|we will get the interest Instead of
|paying it to Great Britain or some
| other country from whom we would
| borrow, that is our own savings would
|do the work formerly done by money
| borrowed across the sea, This means
much to the farmers whose crops are
fininced in this way. Ontario Is more
interested in the loan. because of our
greater industrial activity. The debt
we have’ incurred will only be com-
paratively trifling, when our . popu-
lation Increases to 90 or 100
millions, as ft {8 {bound to do.
We need money for the, re-estib-
lishment of our soldiers, and”in order
to raise this, Canada requires not only
our savings but our credit. and he ad-
vised everyone to buy bonds to the
limit, and then borrow for more. for in
eight months’ time the face value of
the bonds’ would go to 102. "4

Major Tolmle, M.P.P.,, was warmly
received, bdeing introduced by Mr.
Haas as the man who went “oven the
top” in his election. “Thank God the
war’ Is oyer,” he exclplmed. “But,”
he continued, “wo must not allow the
war to get out of their minds; the
mightiest war in“men,. costsand- sacri-
fice in the world’s Mstory, a. war of
great Issues, and we rejoice in the
victory which means the preservation
of our homes, our civilization, our
freedomand our home comforts, which
all, a year or so ago, were hanging in
the balance.” Now the war is over.

WHEAT AND THE LOAN.

 

Everyone with anything at stake in
Canada annually ' watches the pros-
pects of the wheat crop, and the
prices it is likely to yleld., He knows
that on the returns of this commodity
alone depend a. great deal of! the
country's prosperity. If Canada's sue:
plus wheat is sold at good prices the
returns flow into every channel of
enterprise and industry. A fortnight
or so ago the eminent financier. Sir
Thomas White, threw "an important
light on what the Victory Loans:of the
past two years had accomplished In
connection with. this single item of
national prosperity. Great Britain was
and {8 Canada’s greatest market for
wheat; but by reason of the pressure
exerted on her finances during” the
war, the mother land has been unable
to find the ready money to purchase
our surplus. The alternative was that
Canada ‘should lend her the cash;
which returned to the pockets of the
Canadian producer by the sale of the
wheat surplus at high prices, The
enormous importance of this item was
shown by Sir Thomas when he said
that in addition to‘other credits $170,
000,000 had been loaned to Great Brit-
ain In connection with the single com-
modity of wheat, Inst year, Of course
this would” have been Impossible if
he Victory Loansof 1918 had not been
a great success. The circulation of
this “great sum meant prosperity to
vast numbers of Canada's population,
and If the same system fs to be con-
tinued Canddlans” must lend of the

profits and savings with equal enthus+|

Following a wide spread. epidemic

behind {t impaired vitality, and with
the modern conditions of life that use
up nerve force so rapldly, general de-
bility becomes one of” the most” com-
mon maladies. The symptoms of
debility vary, but weakness is always
present. ‘There is poor digestion,
lnngour. weak, aching back, avakeful-
ness at night, often distressing head-
aches and a feeling af fatigue. These
symptoms Indicate impure and im-
