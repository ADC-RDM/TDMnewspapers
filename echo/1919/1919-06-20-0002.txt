ART OF SELECTING DRAPERIES

Wise Choosing and Placing of Lamps
Lends an Air of Coziness to
the Home.

While the selection of draperies and
curtains is, possibly, the most obvious
method of 1dndinog an alr of coziness
to the home, the wise choosing and
placing of lamps Is a factor which Is
equally important, though too Infre-
quently taken advantuge of. To be
thoroughly comfortable and practical
during the evening hours, the home
should be equipped with a varlety of
lamps, to meet the particular needs of
the moment. The fact that one doe
pot want the same kind of lighting &
all times becomes an Important Item
fn the selection and arrangement of
fixtures, for, while a soft, mellow glow
{8 highly desirable for conversational
purposes, It Is usually insufficient for
reading or other close work. The llv-
ing room should therefore be fur-
nished with both types ‘of Immps, so
that it will be satisfactory at el} times.
Proper illumination of this rosm will
do much toward keeping the fomily
together In the evening, for It makes
It possible for severul people to do
thelr different work In comfort.

NEW PATTERN PRINTS SHOWN

Fabric Is Entirely English In Design
and Mapufacture; Firm Like Per-
eale; Dyes Warranted.

Some. new English prints are (nthe
market. They are entirely English Im
design and manufacture, the’ material
is of a firm quality. like pércule and!
the dyes are warranted. ' They come im
all eolors—rose, pink, greens, blues,
terra cotta, or really the new henna—
with the little old-fashioned designs In
purple oc lavender. The patterns are
small, delicate roses on the different
grounds, small conventionnl patterns,
and little lent patterns combined with
a small round figure of - some kind.
There ate a few patterns with the ever
recurrent polka dot of moderate size,
set rather far apurd on white or’col-
ored grounds. ;, Another old-time one
revived is the ting. pinhend dot In
white on navy blue. These, however,
are exceptions, most of the prints be-
fog in small, sometimes very tiny; an:
over designs set closely ~The only
thing In a way of ai stripe is Indefinite,
formed: of lines of the dots.. The
prints make up into very simple gowns
for wornien, children and young girls.
