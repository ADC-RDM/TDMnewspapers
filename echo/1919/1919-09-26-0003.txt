tral powers, the Bible soclety's depot
in Jerusalem, which contained many
thousands of. volumes, had to be aban-
doned hastily. . The workers there
were brought to Egypt on an American

cently nothing whatever was known re-
girding the fate of the depot or its

Turks. But then came a letter from
the society's secretary at Port Sald In-

CANNED SALMON AT

The Fisheries Branch of the Depart-
ment of Naval Service at Ottawa has
arranged with the producers on the
Pacific const to sell canned chum sal-
mon [pn Canada at prices that will en-
able it to be retailed anywhere in the
Dominion, as far east as Montreal in-
clusive, at 18 cents a pound or twa
cang for 35 cents.

At these prices it Is estimated 18
cents’ worth of chum salmon will sup-
ply as much body building material as
B64 cents spent on beefstealey” 56 cents
on a leg of lamb, or 68 cents spent on
pork chops. Chum salmon Is light in

Mr. Fancher comménced his work
several weeks ago in Essex colinty by
motoring from one county to ‘another
where corn crops flourish. His {pip took
him as far edast as Winchester and

ed, as well as Prince Byard.

you will find excellent crops of corn

sald Mr, Fancher when (ntérviewnd by
the News this morning regaraiag his
trip. “In the’ eastern counties there
are some wonderful crops. For fn-
stince, In Winchester corn planted on

not grumble over the results.’ ;

Asked as to the seed prospects for

believed there would be ample to take

that the apple crops in the east are
