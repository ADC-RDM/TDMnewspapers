When a Maid
Laughs

[ 73 J

Syndicate.)

 

When John Lawrence left his home
on the outskirts of town and took the
little path along the nrallrond he
walked as though he were trending on
air. His heart was in tune with all
he world and the autumn sun, just
setting, seemed a great pot of gold, nt
the end of his day's rainbow, beckon-
ing tim on toward éverlasting happl-
ness, Lilliththad given him to under-
stand that afternoon that she really
earcd— Lilith, who had coquetted with
him ever since she began going away
to school. There could be no mistake
about her attitude this time, her open
encouragem@nt perniftting but one in-
terpretation.

“May I come=—tonight?’ he had whis-
pered as he was leaving her,

“Try and see,” She answered coyly,
wafting him a butterfly kiss from the
tips of her fingers. And he was golng
to her now. Hae had determined to set-
tle the future (hAt very evening, come
what may, and he Was thinking with
honest pride, #8 he walked along, of
the comfortable nestegy in the savings
bank which . fie could offer Lilith,
When he was almoS§ in front of the
house he heard a sqund of laughter
and merrymaking frdm within, like a
discordant note in tlie song his heart
was singing, :

“Bother take It!” hd muttered. “Why
couldn't she have beg¢n alone tonight,
of all times?”

“Here he is!” shouted Lillith gayly,
answering “his ring; “let's make him
stir the fudge.”

He was dragged playfully into the

living room, divested of outer gar-
ments and adorned with a huge ging-
ham apron, which Lilith tled under
his arms. —
“Domestic roles fire very becoming,”
she whispered th a blushing smile
which get his Jfeart to beating a brisk
tattoo, “Here's the spoon, and don't you
dare stop beating until I give you per:
mission.”

She closed his fingers over the spoon
with an affectionate pat, turned the
blaze a trifle higher under the chafing
dish, and then left hinu to play a duet
with Hugh Birch; Still John had no
thought save that of being In Lillith's
home for just one purpose, which he
meant to accomplish in spite of vis-
{tors

“Why ill the hilarity here this eve-
ning?’ he Inquired=casually of Nell
Blakesly, who had taken a place be-
side him at the table.

“Nothing special that I know of. Lil-
lith just telephoned late this afterngon
that she thought a chafingg-dish party
would be fun, so we all.canme‘over,”

Lillith Anderson had resorted to her
old trick of playing with fire. once too
often. John was confident she must
have known what he wus coming for

‘| and, with the courage born of’ déspera-

tion, h4 decided there was no time like .
the present; ne

“Lillith, come here,” he callled.

The new: note of determfmation In
his sudden ‘command. startled the girl
into obeying at once, n thing she was!
not in the habitof doing.

“At your service, captain,” she
mocked, saluting, soldier fashion, as

she slipped (nto the chalir vacated by
Nell. “Fudge ready?” é

“I don't know a thipg about It, and
neither do I care n rap!” he andwered
doggedly.” ‘@ came here to see you
alope and you deliberately planned
this—" Br

“ ‘Love 18 like the red, red rose,”
she sang, ‘Interriipting him, while she
took: the spoon from his hand, turned
out the blaze 8iid began beating the
steaming mass a5 though her very life

depended upon it. “Now, fellow citl-
zens,” she calle out, “we'll soon have
something delecigble ‘to please your
sweet teeth, If john will carry it out
to cool.”

She poured the fudge upon a platter
and held it out t§ him in such a half-
frightened, pleadifg way that, as usual,
he! fell before t,o spell of her wonder-
ful eyes and ¢ound himself carrying
the candy obedieytly to the back porch.
But a dash of thy hracing night air re-
established hiS {etermination’ and he
tore off the apray gg he strode angrily
into the hall, ‘ipygt you go, John?"
Lilith [asked timdly, with a faint
note of CONCErn fy her volce. .

“I shall not Siyy here and have you
mock me for OGZ mora second! You
knew—you must lave. known—I was
coming here tonlghe toinsk you to be
my wife, and ¥hu've played with me
Just as 100g 8 yoy're going to! What's
your answer?” y

He led her nfo the vestibule and
shut the door, just as the rest of the
party adjourney tg ‘the back porch to
examine the cabjy go thdy were alone.

“WII you Mitry me9” he went on,
taking her face jotween his hands‘and

pled wi own thoughts to notice

which the heavy train was whirling
with increasing speed from the down
grade behind, He had Just time enough
to jump aslde when the engine erashed
through one end of the little bridge
‘and derailed the two or three cnr be-
hind It. :

Almost Instantly the night alr was
filled with cries of hysterical women,
frightened children nnd the moans of
the Injored, and John Lawrence, for-
getting himself and his troubles com-
pletely, mshed forward to offer ns-
sistance, In_ag incredibly short time
most of the town had flocked to the
scene of the wreck. John worked hard,
pulling away pleces of wreckage, put-
ting out fires which started In many
places and carrying the Injured to
places of safety. |

With a little child in his arms he
wus passing benenth the glare of a
brakeman’s Inntern when two hands
grasped his arm nnd o frightened volce
cried out:

“Thank God, you are safe! IT watched
you start home this way and I was
afrald you might have been killed.’

He placed the child upon a heap of
nearby blankets and gathered the sob-
bing girl in his arms.

“Would you have cared, Lillith?”

“I—should—haye—died—too!” she
whispered. “And, John, dear, I'll never
try to tense you again.”

AS TO MEN AND HUSBANDS
According to This Writer There Is a
Subtle Distinction Between
the Two Species.

 

Immediately after the wedding cere-
mony men become dull and uplnterest-
Ing and turn into husbands, says a
writer In Judge. Husbands are all
Just alike nnd can be sorted out of any
soclal gathering by the same set ex-
pression about the eyes and.mouth.

It Is more trouble to teach a hus-
band to feteh and carry than a fox
terrler puppy, and as a rule the puppy
acts much better when there Is com-
pany around. Husbands walt until
some Sunday morning when you have
distinguished guests with you for ‘the
week end. They burrow in the back
of the closet and pull things off the
high ‘shelves and go through the.rag
bag. Then they appear gt the break-
fast table in the coat of.one sult, the
trousers of another and a fancy vest,
with an inch-wide tie tied In a four-in-
hand as a finish,

And when you advertise your hor-
ror in a frantic effort to convince the
visitors that he is suffering from tem-
porary aberration any nnd every hus.
band will assume an air of bewildered
fnnocence and say: :

“Why, what's the matter with this?
It's just what IL. wear every Sunday
morning when there's no one here!”

Husbands always keep the Sunday
papers on the floor. No man ever does
this until he is married, His mother
will not Tet him.

Husbands rend to you the printed
recipes they find on the woman's page
of the paper. They get enthusiastic
about some dish they ‘have always de-
clared they would rather die than eat
and Say:

“Now, there's an iden for you. Why
can't: we ever have something lke
that?” 7

Women acquire a husband for much
the same reason that a man gets a
cane, They are a fearful bother, but
one presents a better appearance with
one lo land. d ?

WASPS: SWAYED BY EMOTION

Observations Made by Naturalists
Prove That They Have Qualities
Akin to Human Beings.

A book, “Wasp Studles Afield,” by
Phil and Nellle Rau (Princeton Uni-
versity Press) maintalns, giving in-
gtances, that Insects—wasps, to be, ex-
act—feel and display“ emotions,

The evidences ares, plausible. A

pronched her burrow she kicked at
them mogrily and curled her sting

Another \specles certainly displayed
anger when® a, spider she yas pursu-
{ng made one leap and escaped. She
grew, frantic; she became so excited:
over her discomfiture that she acted
madly; walking, leaping and running
about the ground in a frenzy till she
tumbled into a mole's hole.

Still another wasp, examining bro-
ken “ground In” search for her prey,
acted calmly til she arrived at a cer-
taln pile of loose earth. Her demean-

One's Own Interests.

The woman no longer young who Is
earning her livelihood should make: it
a point to save a certain portion of
her salary weekly, no matter how small
it may be. Systematic saving leads
to habits of thrift and gives the per-
son dependent upon her own efforts a
feeling of security. Furthermore, the
woman pust her: first youth will do
well to puss by many dress fads of
the hour. Fashion Is as wavering and
as changeable as an April day, and
the woman who must toll on alone
will assuredly serve her beit interests
by clinging to quiet, conservative ef-
fects.—Exchange. f .
