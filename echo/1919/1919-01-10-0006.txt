Principles of Electric Lighting.

In the year 1800, Volta, a famous
Italian physicist, discovered “that {if
a plate of copper and one of zine
were placed in weak sulphuric atid,
and connected by a wire above the
acid, %Nere. was transmitied along
the wire a certain amount of energy,
which transmission we speak of as
a current’ of electricity, comparing it
10 a current of water, - As (t requires
pressure or head to make water flow,
80 it requires clectric pressure to
make electricity flow. The pressure
of the simple. cel) described above
is called a volt, in honor of ita dis-
coverer., A dynamo, generating 32
volts would have a pressure equal io
that of 32 simple cells.

iFlectric” energy passing throug
fine vwires will heat. them white hot,

nsually has a pressure of 110 volt
when ssupplied by light and power
companites, but private plants usnally
generate only about 32 valts, All
eurrent gemerated by dynamos is al-
ternating whien made, Le, it flows
in one directtton for half a revolu-
tion of the dyynamo and then in the
opposite direestion during the athygr
half, but hy flitting the dynamo with
a’ commutator (which means chang-
er) these wives of current may all
be sent in thie same direction along
the distributiton lines. It is then
called direct cwurrent or D.C.

Now alternatting current, or AN.
may be used for Mghting, just: as
well as D.C. IIt the altérnatjons are

What Everywoman Knows:

Every year, dress fabrics are becoming sheerer and
shecrer—the colors more dainty. The ordeal of trusting
the delicate garments to “soap and water”, however, is
done away with by the use of Lux. :
You may feel quite free to buy the dainticet blouse or
underwear your purse can afford—without a bit of worry
about the washing of them. You keep them fresh and
new the Lux way—simply dipping them up and down in
the creamy, copious Lux suds with never a bit of rubbing

Xi

to injure them.

Lux wont hur! onything that
pure water ilself may touch.
