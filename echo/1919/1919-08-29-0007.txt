CATARRH CANNOT BE CURED

with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease.
Catarrh i3 a blood or constitutional
diseade, and in order to cure it you
must take internal remedies. Hall's
Catarrh Cure is taken internally, and
acts directly on the blood and ‘mucous
surfaces. Hall's Catarrh Cure {s not
a quack medicine. It was prescribed
by one of the best physicians of this
cluntry! for- years and is a regular
prescription: 1t* is“ composed of the
best tonics known, combined with the
best blood -purifiers, acting directly
on the mucous surfaces. The perfect
combination- of the two ingredients
is what produces such wonderful re-
gilts in curing catmrrh. Send; for

“He appeared to be getting along with
the mudhens like a house on fire, but
on Monday or Tuesday last he just
faded away, and now hé is back on his
ocean wave or wherever else petrels
go when they get tired of the company
of mudhens, z=

“But a s)yCcessor has come from
the briny deep to keep up the tradl-
tions of” the blue-watér birds on
Stow lake, He is only a seagull, and
a seagull is not such a rara avis on
terrn as Jur lest friend, the stormy
petrel. Nevertheless he is the first
wild one of his kind that hes ever
tarried with us for two weeks, and
seemed to keep comfortable.

“He has no use for either the ducks
or the mudhens. That is to say, he
does not mix with them. But he has
struck up a friendship with Anthony
and Cleopatra, the two pelicans of
the Nile, and there {8 ne driving him
away from them. . Maybe he. thinks
they will protect him. from the mud-
hens, maybe it Is a case of ‘the de-
