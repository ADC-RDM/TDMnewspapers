The Refinement of

Purity

AREFUL cooks know the value
of purity. In the making: of
cakes or they use those

ingredients which they believe to be
pure and wholesome.

Toapply this “insistence on purity”
to sugar, is no easy matter—for nearly
all sugars look alike to those not ex-
pert in detecting variation. The safe
course is to use a-sugar that comes
from refineries in which purity is a
boast.

+ In the Dominion Sugar refineries
the boast is backed by a standing

dayijation to the public t to Visit and

the plants in which Dominion
Crystal Soeord is made,

! In Dominion Crystal Sugar the house-
wives of Canada have one sugar that can be
depended upon for that Punty which is 0
essential to FR coesstl culinary effort.

This is the only sugar that may be rightly
termed “Canadian ‘from the ground up,
We do import the finest raw cane sugar and
refine it—but our pride is in the product we

make from eatin sugar beets.
