EAR is unavoidable even in the

out miore quickly than others. There is
no nesed of scrapping your car because
the: piiston rings have seen their day,
becauise the platinum points of the
vibrafiors are worn out. Probably the
rest off the car is as good as new. -

REJUVENATE VINEYARDS,
GRAPE EXPERT ADVISES

That J¢ ‘will be profitable to rejuve-
nate many of ithe ald - vineyards in
Ohio is pointed out” by R. B. Cruick-
shanks Secretary of the Ohio Hortl-
cultiral Society. The demand for
grapes «as a fruit and for grape juice
is greater than ever before, despite
the fact that vineyardists had feared
that prohibition , wouid ruin their
business. 3

Nurseries at present are reported fo
be’ unable tol supply the demand for
gripeyines and the future of the bush
ness seems to be guaranteed.

The Ohio Experiment . Station,
Wooster, has maintained. a’ variety
vineyard for a number ‘of years and

‘has tested the productivity of more

that 100 of the American varieties of
grapes. Experimental work In vine-
yard rejuvenation shows that, by
proper cultivation, treatment and for-
tilfzition, old ‘grape’ vines may ‘be
made to bear large amounts, sof fruit.
