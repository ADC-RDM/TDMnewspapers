rival, Franklin: Eyre, cutting his face
open, and for a time he was in a seri-

A court case revealed that a farmer
near, Scarborough paid his hired man,
a returned soldier, $26 a month. The
hired man must have. been<so busy
working that he did not have time to
count his money.

the wilds of the Peace River country,
two American prospectors, F. L.
Sharpe and J. J. Regaledo, settled
their difference. instantly by ‘drawing
their guns and actually murdering

of the two men were found on May

front of their camp, between the Nel-
son and Silken Rivers.

Have Surpassed Pathetic Plea
of Husband Which: Won
Her Her Liberty.

There was a degro family living In
Bowling. Green, Ky. The wife bad
A notoriously ungovernable temper,
usually taking it out on her husband,
who was meek and lowly. Or this oc
casion she struck him with a skillet,
Inflicting a wound so painful and dan:
gerous as to necessitate his having to
be taken to the hospital for treat-
ment. The neighbors, knowing the
violent temper of the wife, and the
eruel treatment she had inflicted upon
her husband for such a long time,
were so outraged they could endure it
no longer, and procured a warrant for
her arrest on the charge of assault
with a deadly weapon.

The husband sat through the trial,
giving rapt attention to Its every de-
tail. The case was handed over to
the jury and after very brief dellbera-
tion it brought fn a verdict of gullty.
The old - darkey husband rose and
sald: :

“Marse Jedge, I don't reckon noth
ing a ole nigger could say would make
mnch diffunce, but 1 would lak to sny
a word before you send the 'old ‘oman
to the penitenshy. She's always been
a good mother to the chillun, all the
neighbors will tell you that. She
washes and scrubs and - sews and
mends for ‘em, and keeps ‘em clean
and nice; an when they's sick she sits
up with’ ‘em at night, ~And, Marse
Jedge, 1 Jest want to ax you (f you
won't let her go by the house and see
the chillun befo' you send her to the
penitensby, They's at home nll alone
right now, cryin’ they po little henrts
out and it would do ‘em good, und the
too; It she could Jost go
and kiss ‘em good-by befo' she was
put In the pénitenshy.™

By this time the judge and the spee-
tators sere In tears: and the judge
safd: “Gentlemen of the jury, 1
haven't passed scotence yet and it
you want a few minutes to further
consider this case, I will be glad to
grant it.” The jury retired and In 0
few minutes returned with’ a verdict
of “net gullty."”
