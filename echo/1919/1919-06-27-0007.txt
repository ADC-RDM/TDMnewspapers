RECORD PRICE FOR SPEECH

Chauncey Depew Tells of Occasion
When a Few Spoken Words Were
Warth Much Money.

In commenting upon the denth of
Mrs. Rtussell Sage, Chauncey M. De
pew, who knew Mrs, Sage for 40 yenrs
and was an Inthinate associate of her
husband for n longer period, told how
he made an £120,000 speech at her sug
gestion,
= Mr, Depew stated that although Mr.
Sage accumulated a vast fortune he
rarely gave away any Imoney, adding
that the reason for this was the con
fidence which he reposed In the judg
ment of his wife as an able and ex
perlenced philanthropist. He sald that
yenrs ago he recelved a letter” from
Mrs. Sage Inviting him to make ap
address at the Emma Willard school,
at Troy, N. Y., upon the occasion of
the donation by Mr. Sage to the school
of 'a large sum of money for use In
erecting a bullding. This was the
gchool of which Mrs. Saga was a grad-
uate.

“I veplied,” said Mr, Depew, “that
I was so overwhelmed with engnge-
ments to speak that it would be ime
possible for me {o accept the invita
tion, | In answer I recelved by special
messenger a note from Mrs, Sage,

“Pwo million,” answered a young

“How did you get them over?’ was
the incredulous query of the Hun,

was the answer. ¥

The German stared.
