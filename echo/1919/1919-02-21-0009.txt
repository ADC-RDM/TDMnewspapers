Corn Binder 1s Time Saver.

With a corn binder and three
horses in corn that is standing well,
three men, one to drive and two to: 5
shock, can harvest about twice as Fi
much as when cutting by hand. From >
seven to nine acres can be cut in a . .
ten-hour day with a binder. The
same three men could scarcely cover i
‘more than four acres in the same
length of time when cutting by hand.
With the binder they-can cut and
shack n 40-acre field of corn in a
week of less, effecting a big saving
in time, though perhaps none fn ex-
pense. The binder delivers the corn
in bundes, which akes , 1b sonsider-
ably casier to both in loading
on wagons and at iy A i
ter. If your acreage In corn is not
large enough to justify an investment
in a modern corn harvester, join with
one or two of your neighbors and
| purchase one co-aperatively. If this
cannot be done, rent a binder—it will. -
take the place of one hired man in
cutting and shocking, or two in cut-
ting corn for ensilage.
