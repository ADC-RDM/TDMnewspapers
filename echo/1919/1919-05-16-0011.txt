tion of the Moorish factions. The
rise of a strong central powcr, the
1 Almoravidee Caliphate, gave new
life to Moorish rule; so that the war
betwegn Christian and Moor e¢bbed
and flowed continvally from the
Douro to the Tagus, Meantime, the
people of Portugal, the. riw material
of the new nation, lay-like on flooded
land awash under this-welter of war-
ring creeds, waiting until the tide of
time should free them from the Asfa-
tic flood; for the ebb and flow of the
Moorish flood had broken up and
beaten down Into one solid society
the Ibetlan, Celtic, Roman and Visi-
gothic elements composing the new
nation. The Portuguese state, unlike
other West European .nations, but
like many Central and t Euro-
pean nations, was mainly the product
“of wars of race and religion; and
wa, may say, perhaps consider, that
Portugal, toward the end of the
Moorish wars, hadealready acquired
a nationality. But it had as yet no
name, and was without any sufficient
territorial holding.

“Late in the Moorish wars we first
find the name of the country as that
of a northern feudal, provinee, the
county of Portugal, so called because
it*contained the Portus Cale ot the
Romans—our Oporto. With the his-
tory of this province the political his-
tory of Portugal begins.

Freight rates are not so serious after all. * We are taking orders every day from J
Farmers who must draw Tile from one to twelve miles at a cost of from $1.50 to
25.00 per M. for 4” Tile, so that a Farmer living 40 miles form Tile Plant and but
three to six,niles from a Railway Station is better off than a Farmer who can only
draw one i a day from the Tile Plant.

REMEMBER THESE FACTS: °

Only a few more Farmers can possibly get their requirements
of tile this year.

Every year you wait you lose at least half the whole cost of
underdrainage. t

Cost of Underdrainage was never cheaper.

He Was Right. ~

Senor Costa, the Portuguese Prime
Minister,” in excusing himself from
making a speech on the ground that
he was no orator, told an amusing
anecdote at a luncheon pérty given in
his honor during his recent visit to
London. It appears that when first
put up for the Portuguese National
Council he prefaced his opening ad-
dress to the electors by alluding
frankly to his lack of oratorical
gifts. After he had finished a man
pushed forward, grasped his hand
warmly, and said: “Senor, I've been
a lifelong opponent of yours, but at
the coming election I shall vote for
you.” “Thank you,” replied Costa,
much gratified. “May I ask the par-
titular reason forkyour change of
views?” “Because you are the first
speaker on elther side that ‘I have
heard tell the truth,” was the réply.
“You said when you began that you
couldn't make much of ‘a speech, and
by heavens, senor, you can't.”
