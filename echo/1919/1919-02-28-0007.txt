being well taken care of andfthe oth-
er placed in a barn as corn is ordi=
narily, cribbed. THe well-preserved *
seed gave a yield on poor soil 12 per
cent. higher than the poorly-preserv- 48
ed ind 27 per cent, higher on fertile
goll, notwithstanding thé fact that !
both lots ot seed germinated equally

slightly damaged: Prevention ds bet-

is Impossible.
4 It dt is found TiCCessary to plant |

seed the vitality of which is at all 23
doubtful, each ear should be testad
separately and only those planted
which germinate perfectly.

If the only seed available for :
planting is inferfor In quality and vi- .
tality, it should be planted thick in oo
order to counter-balance {mperfect
germination and to approximate per-
fect stands. Poor standd are a fre-
quent source of poor yields,’ In near-
ly every locality good farmers wus-
ually agree regarding the stand that
approximates the optimum for nor-
mal” soll and seasonal conditions.
Stands markedly, Inferior to the opti-
mum give an increase in size of ears, J
but a decrease in total yield. Loss >
miy be sustained from too thick au . Ek
stand, which causes a decrease in size
of ears and In total yields.

a profitable corn crop the following
season. - Dropping all other business “5
at corn-ripening. time and selecting, : i
drying and storing at least enough
seed to meet the requirements of two
years’ planting will insure a seed sup- oo \

he will get ‘very best that is to ~~
be had and fleserve it well, his in-
creased yields will return him more
profit than other work he can

do. on his farm. 2
- The same day seed corn is gather-

the ears do not touth each other.
