“Three years ago, I began to feel

very much from Liver and Kidney

The result was surprising.

not known for a good many years—
that is, the blessing of a healthy

AFTER THE TOBACCO TRUST.

A man very prominent in Univers-
{ty and Labor circles in Toronto
claims there is a movement on foot,
headed by same of the college frater-
nad organizations there, to organize a
world-wide strike against the exorbit-
ant prices now charged by the tobac-
co trusts in Europe and In America
for their goods, whether it be cigars,
chewing tobacco, smoking tobacco or
cigarettes. While the war tax on 1o-
bacco has gone up in all countrie, to-
bacco has been increased in price to
the consumer two or three times the
amount of the war tax ‘without any
justifinble reason therefor. Raw to-
bacco is cheaper, but labor is higher.
An appeal to supperk the. strike, it is
sald, is also to be made to all soldiers
and sailors who have served in the
great war, and also to all secret gocle-
ty organizations; and that while {it
may be some time yet before the
thing will be effective, it will ha very
sweeping in its results. It will bring
the tobacco.trusts to thelr knees in
one day.

OUR HOG PRODUCTS ARE

Removal of Embargo Would Militate
Against Ascendency Over
Enemy.

A new. development has taken place
in connection with the pork products
contracts formerly placed by the. Brit-
ish ernment in Canada and re-
cently cancelled. Tt appears that Can-
adlan packers, who have large stores
of po products ready for shipment
overseas abled a request to the Brit-
h authorities that the hould be al-

to ship to and «¢ nse of sur-

tocks in neutral countries, where’
a strong market exists. They further
askéd that the difference between the
price roceived and the price guaran-
teed by Breat Britain be made up by

| the British Government.

Windsor, membership in the church

The request was refused. The rea-
son given was that should the embar-
go on’shipments to neutral nations be
lifted at this time the products would
likely find thelr way ultimately to
Germany and thus impair the agcen-
dency of the Allies at the Peac¢k#Con-
ference. It Is pointed out that {t was
blockade that? hastened the eom-
pl ite defeat of the Germans and their
i .
y question remains as to swlat

Capada. They might © gradually be
placed on the domestic market, That
would have the témporary effect of
reducing prices to the consumer,
whereas the packer woulds not suffer
