Eradication and Control of Disease,

Spraying with fungicides, which is
So effective in controlling the ‘fung-
ous diseases of plantsy'is of no wvail
with bactérial diseases, as the bac-
terin. which cause the disease act
in the interior tissue rather than on
the surface; hence the spray will not
reach them,

Spraying with insecticides i help-
ful’ indirectly, sas it tends. to keep
in check the insects, slugs, cater-
pillars, ete., which are one of the
most common means of spreading
bacterial diseases from one plant to
another. "

As a rule, the best-method to adopt
in dealing with’ a plant Infected with
bacterial disease is to earefully” re-
move and burn It. Insects, garden
tools, etc., coming in contact with
ft will spread the disease to the
plants®with which they come in con- |
tact later.

Therefore, in order to prevent
loses from bacterial soft rot of
plants, remove and burn affected
plants, or parts of plants, a8 soon as
observed; be careful during cultiva-
tion mot to wound plants, and keep
caterpillars, slugs and biting insects
in check. Affected plants should |:
never be put on the compost heap |
or. manure pile, ¥

Harvesting and Storing.
When harvesting and storing tur-
nips, cauliflower, cabbage, celery,
tomatoes, or other vegetables - from
crops. in which the disease has been
present, great care should be taken
not to include any specimen that
shows the slightest appearance of
the disease, or to smear the healthy
specimen with the soft rotted parts
of diseased specimens, If these pre;
cautions are neglected, the disease is
liable*-to establish itself and spread
more or less rapidly through the en-
tre crop stored.—D, H. Jones, B.S:A.,
