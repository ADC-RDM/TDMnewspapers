TOBACCO ROT-ROT CONTROL.

 

This Is a matte that should engage
the attention nd thought of all
tobacco grower; especially those
growing White kirley.

The heavy losse sustained by the
growers In the pag: demand an hon-
eat effort to controlor, at least, re-
duce the losses fromthis disease to a
minimum through catrol measures.
Due largely to cominuous cropping

tobacco, ‘ together with the trans-
planting of diseased seedlings from
the plant beds, a grea deal of land in
the tobacco growing asntres of On-
tario has become {ufestell with the dis-
cage. Just how long the soll will
maintain the digease is nd definitely
known, - However, it" is fe to say
that such lands should not be devoted
to tobacco for fiva to ten years, much
depending on the degree af infection
and the texture and dralmge of the
80il. These infested or slek solls
should be devoted to crops that are
not hosts of this disease, nymely corn,
cereals and grasses, such as timothy
and red top; in fact, almost any crop
except -red clover and other legumes.
These fields should remaln In grass
4s a meadow and grazing land for
several years, apparently the longer
the better, to Insure a riddance of the
digeage,

The growers of White Burley and |
snuff tobacco should practice at least
a four-year rotation of crops, tobacco |
being grown onthe same fle ld every
fourth year, There arfstong indica-
tions that tobacco devoted to the
same fleld every sixth or eighth would
be much better to hold the disease {n
check.

Only thoroughly drained soils should
be selected for growing tobacco. Such
solls with a proper humic content will
warm up more quickly, thus stimulat-
ihg more rapid plant growth, at the
same time checking the spread of the
disease jn the soll, for it has been
shown that the root-rot fungus makes
poor growth when a temperature of
80 degrees F. in the soil has been ob-

tained.
Transplant only strong, healthy
seedlings. - Past observations. have

shown that much of the trouble in the
fleld was due to transplanting diseased
seedlings from the plant beds,

Cool, cloudy weather for several
weeks just after transplanting favors
the spread of the disease on infected
soils, = Such conditions are unfavor-
able for rapid growth of the plants,
which In turn become Infected nd
are rapidly overcome by the disease.
When the crop, in general, {8 over-
come by the disease early in the sea
Bon, no amount of cultivation Bed
labor will stimulate the plants to make
a paying yield. In order to save a
useless waste of time and labor, the
crop should be ploughed under and the
fleld summerfallowed and souR to
grain In the fall,

Where the use of “root-rot” difensed

soils eannot. be avolded for tobacco [*
growing, only “root-rot” rdsistant
strains Should be grown. Results"have
shown that resistant strains make a
fair yield" on these solls where the
ngn-résistant strains were, an abso-
date failure.
* From all evidence on hand .at the
present time, the growing of resistant
strains together with a more extensive
practice of crop rotations are the best
methods for checking the losses from
this disease,

For a quarter hour only the crickets

ton orchard, swhere old Toblus and Je-
mima and Minerva, thelr granddaugh-
ter, ussorted some mighty mounds of

fullen winesaps. Then Minerva spoke,
“Znck wants me to run off and mar-

ry: him, grandpappy, after fodder

“Lord, Nervy, don't ye!” old To-
blas’ faded eoyes were plteously be-
seeching. “Stay by us, honey. No-

body feels for us old ones like you do,
Nervy I”

Minerva smiled faintly. “I told
Znck,« grandpappy, I couldn't marry

me off and surely mistreant you and
grandmaommy if I married agninst her

and to keep her services she had de

take Into her house and rule, as she
did Joshua, the girl's henpecked fa:

By her orders, Zachariah Burden,
who was not the “humble sort” she de-
sired for a son-in-law, stayed away
from the Compton house, but Znck
was resourceful and managed often
fo see the gentle little creature who
was like a guardian angel to the old

“Cryin’, Jemimy?" old Tobias, sitting
smoking on_their bedroom hearth that
evening, asked uneasily. Jemima
‘wiped her eyes

“I got to studyin' about Minervy a

of us and ip. worried me some, Blas!”
she confessed,

After Jemima slept, Blas still sat on
the hearth. Minerva was delicate, like
thelr little Hettle who had died; six-

His bhéav-groans awakened Jemima,

“The pain Doc Higgins said was

he labored out, his hand clutching his
chalr rungs, his rugged old face

Jémiman tremibled as ‘she measured

The circus coming to Caneyville had
advertised a prize of $10 In gold to
be given to' the young woman not
afrald and willing to be married on an
elephant's back In their ug, which
advertisement doubled and tripled the
size of the attending crowd on the
“show day,”

Early that morning Zack Burden's
two mulés passed the Compton wagon,
en route to Caneyville. Zack rode one
mule, Magnolia Rouse the other.
Eliza could not restrain a look of dis-
pleasure,

“Them two are the pair that's to
be married on the elephant's back!”
old Blas volunteered cheerfully.
“Zack's done arranged with the show
folks.” i

This news was the last straw,
Eliza turned to her daughter, her face
white with wrath,

“Nervy Compton, before I'd let
everybody In the county see that low-
down Rouse girl take my feller right
before my eyes, I'd jump In Caney
river!”

Minerva smiled. “Their weddin'
won't discredit me, ma. Zack's not
my feller now, and all the folks know
he wanted to marry me and you
wouldn't let him!"

At the close of the cireus perform
ance, the lnrgest and gentlest elephant,
with a howdnh on his back, was
brought ‘into the ring.

“WII the gentleman who wishes to
be married please present himself?”
the ringmaster called out,

Zack arose and took Magnolia's
arm, but she pulled back, screeching
foolishly. “I'm afrald of the elephnnt!
I'm afraid to get close to the thing!”

“Will the gentleman try to persuade
another lady then? Were bound to’
have a wedding!” Thgfbliggest clown
rolled over in a gale pf merriment, but
it was tragedy to Efiza.

Zack looked about him. “I see one
lady I know Is not afraid of the ele-
phant that would maybe marry me,
but she's afraid of her ma!”

Eliza sprang to her feet,

“If you mean Minerva, Zack Bum
