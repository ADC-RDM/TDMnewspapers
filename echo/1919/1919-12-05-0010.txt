A large number of ratepayers Jrom

Amherstburg and Anderdon attended
the meeting at the town hall Friday
evening to hear Sir Adam Beck's ex-
planation of the proposed purchase
of the S., W. & A. railway system by
the Hydro-Electric Power Commis-
sion. As Malden will. no doubt, bo
connected up by an extension of the
4dne within a very short time, quite
a number of ratepayers from that
township were also present
Sir Adam and his party,
fng Mr. Gaby, Chief Engineer;
Winters and Alderman I
Windsor, were an hour late owing to
a delay of the London train, so the
meeting did not start until 8 o'clock.
Mayor Park presided: :
Mr. Gaby spoke first, explaining the
manner in which the estimates were
prepared and why the Commission
had decided to submijt the agreement
and had arrived at the cost at which
they proposed to purchase the road.
He sald that the first resolution they
received was in 1915, when they were
asked for information as to the cost
of acquiring this railway. In April,
1919, resolutions were: received from
nine border municipalities asking that
the railway be acquired d operated
by these municipalities and on re-
ceipt of these resolutions their engin.
eers were sent to proj inven-
tory of the D. U. R.'s*ho in Es-
SEX COLNtY, 1 h these engineers

used. They were unable to come to

an agreement at first but at a subse-
quent meeting the valuati arrived
at and agreed upon was $2,038,000.
The engineers employed by the Com-

 
 

 

mission are experts in all lines in
both el ».and steam roads and
had the asgistance of the General Elec-
tric Co. The trafic conditions were
studied to estimate the receipts, the
service and traffic that could -be ob-
tained by improvements; and they
concluded that the road would pay

all operating expenses, interest and
sinking fund. The above amount in-
cludes depreciation and a sum to
maintain the property and rgnewals,
The amount distributed to AVindsor,
Walkerville and Sandwich yfas accord:

sider {t an equitable basis. to dis-
tribute the cost amounts according to
the equalized assessment of the area
served. In addition to the bonds to
be-Tssued for payment of the road and
property, thé Commission requires an
additional $2560.000 to extend the line
and /e better service. The by-law
is based on the same basis as that on
which the municipalities are receiv-
ing Hydro-Electric, power.

Nerstburg for t st time, was «ery
warmly received as he arose ta spread

theme of his remarks was “Service at

municipa s,- but operated by the
Hydgo-Electric Commission, who are
trustees of the whole people. The

That the trunk railways operating |
in Ontario must fall back on electric
energy, which the Commission is pre
pring to generate at Chippewa Falls
and other places in the province, was
declared by the power head. The
shortage ‘of coal, which, he said, is
becoming more serious every winter,
will compel railway companies to

At the conclusion of Mayor Wintar's
remarks, Sir Adam received three
chears, and departed with his party
to Sandwich, where he was to ad-
dress another meeting. N

F. A. Hough advised the electors to
consider two things in approuching
this question: . gL

1—Are we getting what we ara buy-
fng at-the right price. =

Experts of the Hydro-Electric Com-
mission advise us that we are, as, ex-
plained by Sir Adam Beck, who en-
joys the confidence of the people of
the Province to asremarkable degree.

2—How are we going to pay for it?

F. W. Haas considered this a ram op- |
portunity, as the Hydro is one clihe

tributed. among the municipalities, If
our proportion seems higher now, Am-
herstburg will get a greater share
later. There Is no Instance where
the. Hydro has asked a municipality
to pay a deficit. Windsor undertook
a security of over a million or Hyiro
light and power, and though there
was a defleit for a counle of years the
Hydro Commission carried that until
the system became self sustaining. A
corporation's instructions to its man-
agers are to show them dividends;
the Hydro soys: “Give service to the
people.” Good features of the pro
