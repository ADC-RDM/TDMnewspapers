Jf Kent, on Thursday morning, On a
motion by Mr Mc big, of Kent,” sec-
onded by Frank Glass. of East Middle-

should be discussed dt the mext meet-
ing of the committee on Wednesday.
Mr. McColg pointed out that in one
factory in Canada, forty-seven aif-
farent kinds of wagons were minufac-
tured. He further stated that, the
parts of a mower Or reaper manufac-
tured - during any particular year
would not in many. cases fit the same
make of mower manufactured during
another year, "If both the implements
and parts were standardized, the cost
te the public would be much Jess.

and went into. the details’ of the
scheme. The muskox are indigenous
to @anada, but are being depleted by
