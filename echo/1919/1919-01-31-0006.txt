ANY people forget that a
hen requires feeds other
than grain in order to be in
good health and to lay.

All-grain rations are neither con:
ducive to health or egg production.
At times when hens have the run of
the stables and the yards, together
with house scraps, they do very well,

owing to the fact that an opportunity
js given them to pick up bits of
clover leaves, roots, «nd such like
material,

A certain amount of meat foods 8

feed is apt to cause trouble with the

the best animal feed known. It gives
the best results when sour. When
birds are accustomed to it they will
not take too much.

Beef scrap angd high-grade tankage
are used very extensively on large
poultry plants where milk is not
available, These are mixed with
ground grain, generally in the pro-
portion of fiftéen to twenty per cent.
For the general purpose breeds the
former amount is sufficient, Breeds
such as Leghorns will make good use
of twenty per cent. of meat scrap in
the ration.

Cooked butchers’ meat, green cut
bone, cooked beef head, lungs, liver,
ete,, are all very good feeds and may
be fed in a manner similar to meat
scrap.

Some people think that because a
little of meat feeds are good, more
would be better, Experience has
shown that such is not the cage. Too
much often causes serious trouble.

Green feeds are cssential for
health and far economy. A hen
should have all the green feed she
will consume. A certain amount of
bulky, succulent green feed she will
consume. Such feed is usually {alrly
inexpensive. Where birds are not fed
any green feed, in the course of time
they become unthrifty, lny poorly and
moreover, the eggs from such birds
many times are very low in hatching
power,

Experience has shown that oats
when properly sprouted are a most
excellent feed. The hens.are very
fond of them and the value of the
oats as on feed is good. That fs, the
sprouted oats reduce the grain’ feed
consumption equal to the pounds of
oats sprouted and one gains the in-
creased palatability of the oats, as
well as the value from the gréens.

Thin-leafed greens contfiln oné of
the very {important $lements of
growth and health, They are called
nature's, protective feeds; that is
they assist to maintain the birds’
health or normal resistance against
disease, Health 1s hn essential to
profit. In winter we find such feed
in sprouted oats, cabbage, and clover
leaves,—Prof., R. W, Graham, O. A.
College, Guelph,

Value of Concentrates In Ration.

A cattle feed is valuable to the ex-
tent it contains those substances
which will repair body tissue,-build
new tissue and furnish energy to. do
work, The particular materials in a
food which have this power are pro-
tein, ‘the flésh-forming substanee,
carbohydrates and fat, the fat and
energy producers and the mineral
matter which has a great many fune-
tions in the body.

Any feed that carries a high per-
céntage of protein and fat and a
large amount of a digestible form, of
the carbohydrates is called a conoen-
trated feed or r concentrate. Thus
grains, mill feeds and -oll cakes are
concentrfites, On the othér hind, a
feed 'low In ‘these valuable constitu-
ents and high: in indigestible carbo-
hydrates, or crude fibre, as, for in-
stance, straw, hay, ‘corn stalks, are
called roughage or bulky feeds. Roots
may also be put in this class because
they contain a very high percentage
of water and they are for this reason
bulky. r

These bulky feeds have, thelr place
in" the ration, indeéd in the case of
full-frowh animals on maintenance
ration, they may form the whole of
the food; but it {8 impossible for a
young animal to make rapid growth,
a cow lo give a large amount of milk
or a horse to work hard on such
feed. The hard woody fibre of the
straw and hay are difficult to digest
and much of the energy that should
go to production of work or ‘increase
is used up jn digesting the food.
Consequently when production fs de-
sired the abiount of roughage feed
must be’ reduced and the cencen-
trates increased.

Another reséipn why concentrates |
must be used is that to get the ped
est production {ve must have the anj-
mal digest and jhsorb the maximum
amount of the various constituents
