AFTER THIRTY- EIGHT YEARS

Receipts Turn Up to Show that the
the Township Collector of Colches-
ter South Paid $600.00 Twice.

A very Interesting explanation jn
the nature almost of a sensation was
made at the nomination meeting here
by Wm. Hughson, retired farmer and
lifelong resident of Colchester South.
t will be remembered by the older
residents and it {8 known to most of
this townshfp in the year 1880, when
the younger generation, that Mr. Hugh-
son unfortunately was found to be
$600 In arredrs as collector of taxes in
tihs township In the year 1880, when
it came to a settlement with the treas-
urer. He believed at the time that he
had paid every cent [nto the treasurer
that he had collected, but as he could
not account for it by vouchers, he
mortgaged his farm in order to pay
the debt. In those days such a word
ns “efficiency” applied to municipal
accounting was not known. bookkeep-
ing was very crude Indeed, and many
collectors and treasurers went short in
their accounts by reason of this sys-
tem more than through any dishon-
esty. Recently Mr. Hughson decided
to sell some old pleces of furniture by
uction, and on cleaning out a drawer
in a desk that he had had for nearly
fifty years, discovered among other
papers a number of receipts among
which. was one for $430, given him by
the Harrow school section, and anoth-
er for $144.66 given him by S. S. No.
2, Colchester, as a collector fn those
days paid the school sections direct
rather than through the municipal
treasurers. These receipts were both
dated 1880, bore the skgnature of the
respective school treasurers and were
sealed with the seal of the school sec-
tion, and had never been audited. As
it 18 a fact that Mr. Hughson could not
pay money out without having#re-
celved it, no doubt these receipts’ are
authentic and wedount for his shortage
at the time, because they were not
turned in to the treasurer as cash as
they should hive been when the an-

al settlement was made, and he was
found to be short somé six hundred
dollars. Mr. Hughson appealed to the
ratepayers at the nomination for their
judgment as to whether hefin all fair-
ness should not be reimbursed his
$000, paid 38 years ago, not to speak
of the interest on the original pay-
ment made in error. The ratepayers
expressed their opinion that it was a
matter which should be dealt with by

the incoming cquneil.
