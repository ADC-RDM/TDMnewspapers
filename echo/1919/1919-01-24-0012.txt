mtown who patronized Miss Kel-
ogg that when she cashed In her old
machine a few years before and got a
new one she had threatened to get a
“gingle threader,” but loud had becn
the objections. Her patrops didn't
want to run the risk of having seams
come undone In church or at soclables,
as they had heard of their doing when
sewed In that careless manner.

The doctor had never called on Mar-
garet before except professionally once
or twice, and this was not exactly a
socinl enll. He hod been designated
by the loce) authorities as one of-ghose
to help with the Thrift stamp canvass
and be had, much ns he disliked to do
It, to find out from each person on the
street just how much he or she would
invest in Thrift stamps before the first
of the next year. y

Margaret didn't hesitate In explain-
Ing so long as she might hand she not

‘heard the doctor's confidences two
months before. Her excuses were
much the same. Farnamtown was
slower pny than ever and thrend and
findings were getting higher every day.
What If she did charge a little more
to cover the-incrense? If the ladies
didn't pay “till year after next that
really didn't help. So except perhaps
for one or two stamps she could make
no promise. She would like to dis-
pense with her one apprentice and
save her small wage, but she was an
odd little girl—daughter of a poor
widow—and If Margaret didn't employ
her goodness knows who would; and
then what would become of her?

If there were only something she
could do to earn a little extra. every
once In a while—she had heard of peo-
ple doing that. So had the doctor and
he, too, wished that In Farnamtown he
might find some simple task to per
form by which he might earn the lit-
tle necessary to make his small sub-
scription to. government loans and
Thrift stamps.

Now they had both told each other
their little predicament and somehow
they felt that there was somithing bes

pleasurably and then Io a twinkling
she stood beside him with’a slice of
her light, outmeal war bread and a lit-
tle saucer of fresh: cherry jam to be

 

i snmpled.

That was how It began. The doctor
sald he had some cherries going to
waste on his place. He couldn't sell
them and he cquldn’t ent them all. He
smacked his lips over the sample and
sald he could well afford to pay a 1it-
