In connection with the foreman on the several road divisions, I might
say that In some places fault 18 found because he will not let everyone on
the rond as under the old road-work system. Im support of the foreman, I
wish it understood that when we appoint & foreman on a division, we expect
him to do the work, for we have to go to some trouble to educate him to do
it the way. we want it done, and If he puts some of his neighbors on, they
will do the work as they please, and in many cases have undone the work
that the forenman has done. For you know everyone has their own idea about
fixing a road, hut after we have instructed our foreman in order to havea
uniform systemn of maintenance we cannot afford to have it undone because
some man pays, “I want to work on the road.” v
