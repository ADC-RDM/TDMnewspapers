LIFTING ,OF EMBARGO
IS LIKELY TO FORCE

UP PRICE OF WHEAT
The announcement that the United
States will lift the embargo against
the importation of Canadian wheat
on December 15th Has created deep
interests throughout the country, and
the’ generdl Mmpression-1s that the
actfon of. .the Washington authori
ties will work to the advantage not
only of the Canadian farmer, but of
Canada at large, In the, first place

the Canadian farmer willysecure the|D

spread which now exists between “the
Canadian Initial price and .the price
in the United States market. In the
second place, the wheat will be sold
for cash and not for credit as at pres-
ent, and in the third place, the ex-
change situation may be adjusted and
established. A

The United Slates guaranteed” a
price of $2.25 per bushel for the 19198
crop. “But United . States millers
have been paying as high as $2.80 for
certain grades of hard wheat for’ mix-
Ing purpgses. Canadian farmers near
the boundary have been teaming their
‘wheat across the boundary and real-
izing a difference of from 20 to 60
cents per bushel over the initial fixed
Canadian price

It is fully anticipated that, the ‘ac-
tion of the United States will force
the price of'wheat in Canada up above
not only the Canadiang initials price,
but tire total which will be paid when
the wheat Is disposed of by the wheat
controllers, for the reason that it is
more profitablexto«sell to the United
States than to Great Britain-on a
basis of cash versus credlt,sand with
United States currency at a preminm
instead of ar a discount.

WINDSOR MEAT HIGHER
THAN IT SHOULD BE

 

Board “of Commerce Commissioner
3 Finds Druggists Get 100 Per
Cent. Profit.
re ———

Prices of meats in Windsor. are
higher than in Hamilton or Toronto.
This fact was brought out in the
investigation before Board of Com:
merce Commissioner James Murdoch.
Meat prices, according to Mr. Mur-
doch, should be lower.on the border
than they are. Detroit cannot affect
meat prices in Windsdr, one witness
declared, but at the same time he
pointed out that hundreds of citizens
go to Detroit” for their meat, a8 no
duty ‘is collected on small package:
of meat by Customs officers. Var
fous members: of ‘the Trades and
Labor Council testifying expressed
'matisfaction at the cost of clothing
on the border. The general opinion
was that the price of clothing wae To
higher in Windsor than In other
cities of the province, High prices
because of proximity to Detroit Mr.
Murdoch stated, can be accounted for
to some extent by the higher over
head expenses, such as rent, whieh
local. merchants are forced to pay.
Investigation of prices for drugs in
Windsor shows that druggists are

RIVER FRONT ROAD.

 

Editor of The BEcho:—
A notice has appeared in recent is.

sues of The Echo of a proposed by-
law lo close ‘up a portion of the
River Front road In the Township of
Malden, by diverting it some four or

five hundred feet east

It {5 dificult to understand how
anyone, outside of the real estate
dealers who are promoting this
scheme, could advocate such a
change. Nature has done more to
beautify this section ofthe township
than perhaps any other locality in all
‘Western Ontario and to undo this to
satisfy the whim of two or three par-
tles who imagine they could then sell
their ots to better advantage, would
be nothing short of a crime against
the general public.

These gentlemen offer to give the
Township a strip of land for a new

July 17th last, disappeared from the
home of Thomus Waters. where he
and his mother-were staying fn the
hope that quiet life along the river
would restore lis health that had
been badly shattered by army life in
Oklahoma. Every effort was made at
the time to find him, and It was fear
ed he had drowned. until the canoe
in. which he disappeared turned up at
Monroe, Mich. A week ago he was
found wandering - in a dazed cond}
fon in the Boston & Albany railroad
yards by detectiyes, and pave his
name as Harry Gibson. His polished
manners. and signs of education led
the Chief of Police to suspect that
he was other than the man he clalm-
ed to be, and he was about to be com-
mitted to an nsylum when the court
order was stayed for further examin-
ation and his real idontity was re-
vealed. Leroy B. Blinn was a well
