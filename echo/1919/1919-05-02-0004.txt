§ At the council meeting,
night, Mr. Bertrand, connciillor, in-
quired as to the disposition of the
audit of tie town's-agcounts for 1918,
and was told that tiie audit wms com-
pleted and was at his -disposall. This
was strictly according< to the: facts,
but at thé same time His Worshilp, who
replied to Mr. Bertrand's imquiry,
knowing as he does the interesit the
annual audit has for the ratepayers,
might have -gone"a step further and
informed Mr, Bertrand that whilie the
andihad been In the Glerk’ hamds for
a couple of weeks, it had ngt heen so
reported to the council. This proce-
dure ls not abgplutely necéssamy, but
{t has been customary in years: past;
and a good safe rule to follow: as in
the past, is the reading of the aibstract
and discussion around the boand. = It
gives every councillor an oppwriunity
to become seized of the flinancial
standing of the town ler wopresents
and an insight into sthe warled ac-
gounts, ‘thus acquaiting liim with
matters he should know if the town is
to get his most efficient service. Then
the people have a right to met the in.
formation contained In the audit; of
thelr accounts at the carliest possible
opportunity, and with this very object
in view the Municipal Act has. the
follwing clause relating to nuditors’
reports in local municipalities: “The
clerk shall publish the abstrack. state-
ments and reports in such form as the
council may direct; and In the case
of a local municipality shall transmit
a copy.of the abstract and statements
to the Clerk of the Council of the
County., and the same shall be kept
in ‘his office,” Every taxpayer is en-
titled to this information, and - muni-
cipal officers make a grave mistake
in arousing a suspicion that am attempt
