It rose, month by month, to greater,

operation of the Liberals he hoped to
attain’ the goal, If we sheathe the

There is very little difference be-

forms: except that the latter has the

be that if a bill is introduced in the
House, the Farmers’ member will have
to consult his constituents before he
