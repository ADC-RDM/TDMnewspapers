Proof that Some Women
do Avoid Operations a

Mrs. Etta Dorion, of Ogdensburg, Wis., says: A=
«oY suffered from female troubles which caused jercing pains PN
like a knife through m bask ad Side. d grally Jost al Pr ]
ngth bad to to e doctor advised an operation
ore ot ht of what I had Say about
Lydia E. Pinkham's

Vegetable Compound and tried it. The first
bottle brought great relief and six bott

les have entirely cured me,
All women who have female trouble of any kind should try
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.”

How Mrs. Boyd Avoided an Operation.

Canton, Ohio.—*I suffered from a female trouble which
caused me much suffering, and two doctors decided that
I would have to go through an operation before I could

t well.

Ely mother, who had been helped by Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound, advised me to try it be-
fore submitting to an operation. It relieved mefrom
my troubles so [ can do my house work without any

culty. I advise any woman who is afflicted with
female troubles to give Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound a trial and {it will do as much
for them.” — Mrs. MARIE Boyp, 1421 5th St.,
