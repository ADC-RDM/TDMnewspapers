service can be successful. No traps-
action satistactory. Unpleasant sit-
uations are all solved by the one
word. No prosperity will prove per-
manent unless this one word is part
of the plan--it is the cordial virtue
that holds the world in the Light of
God’s clear method and this one
word is TRUTH.
