his “home he felt i was worth
more to him.” “Now what price sould
be the actual value of the ‘farms?’
asked the speaker. In usban muonlci-
palities the task of the assessor fs
even more difficult. A house costing
$6,000 to build In one section of a city
would readily rent or seliefor more
than a similarly constructed house in
another part of the city. Should both
the houses bo assessed at the same
j valuation? Fve years ago it cost less
to build a house than it does to-day. The
| price of building matérial has gone up
and consequently the value of the
house Built in pre-war days also has
gongaup. Would it have been fair to
incrense the taxation on that house
because the value of materials during
abnormal times have soared? 1 think
not, To my mind there {8 no basis
from which an assessor can arrive at
the actual value of rural lands, dwell
ing houses and business places; there
an’ official entrusted to  asBess
property for taxation must use his
own judgment.” Regarding the col

dystem of arranging the lats cansecu-
tively in each concession so that any
Jot can be located without searching
the whole roll. Blue prints prepared
by the engineer, showing the number
of names of owners, acreage and num-
bers would be useful to council mem-
bers and officials. Several members
expredgsed thelr wie¢sss upon the mat-
ter dealt with in the paper, and were
of the opinion récommendations should
be made to the Ontario Municipal As-
sociation. This met with general
favor, and the motion to deal with the
