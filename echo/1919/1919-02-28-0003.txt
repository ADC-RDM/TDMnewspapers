The Heifer freshened in pasture
on the 15th of October, 1917, at’ the
agé of 2 years, ‘1 month, 15 days.
She was starteq on test on the 21st

cogrespondence with his friend, and
ane of his greatest sorrows at leaving
Indiana was the fact that he could not
remain to cast hig ballot for the Demo-
cratic ticket which was headed by
Cleveland and his friend.

All through the present war, Mr. and
Mrs. Strachan have done their bit in
countless ways. Mrs. Strachan made,
some time ago, a patchwork quilt,
which she donated to the Red Cross,
Since this quilt was given, it has been
sold and resold, bringing a-totall of
$450 to the organization. Mr. Strachan
owns a large amount of Liberty bonds
and Government securities. J

t. has been p wonderful privilege,
Mr. Strachan says, to have «lived
through this great world war, and to
have had a part in the things which
bave been done during the past few
years. He considers it as the greet.
