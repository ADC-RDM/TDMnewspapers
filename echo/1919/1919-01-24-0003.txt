The “Welcome ” sign. still hangs high én the doors of the
Salvation Army Hostéls. Help them to keep it-there! - While
our soldiers have need of the comforts—spiritual as well as
bodily—DON'T shut thesdoors inthe boys’ faces—Keep them
smiling! +
The''Salvation Army appeals for a Million Dollars for the
boys who won-the victory. « This is the Arst time the Salva-
tion Army has‘made a general appeal for its work, We urge
you now, for the sake of the soldiers, and as a VITAL. factor
in the sohition of Canada’s. Reconstruction problems, with
the Homecoming of her boys, to give and to give liberally:

Our men in Khaki may not all be home for another year.
While there is a company of Canadians'in uniform over there

The weary waiting and the relaxed discipline spell dangers
that MUST be guarded against. A happy smile and a com-

A WORD ABOUT THE HOSTELS!—Have you ever been
inside a SalvatioR Army Hostel? If not, ask a returned
man about the Hostels in Paris, London, Toronto, Hamilton,
or any others that he has stayed in.over HERE.

Let HIM tell you about the REAL beds, the home cooking,

; the fried eggs, and hot coffee—and hot baths. If he lmows
you very well, he may give you a hint about the spiritual
comfort the Salvation Army Lassies give these men far from
