“Number 9's loaded,” he announced,
meaning, to a young man at the desk,
scanning the chart of loaded freight
care. “Are you ready?’

The young man shuddered, but
turned resolutely to Barnett.

“Yes,” he snapped between clenched
teeth. “But I think it's a fool's er-

Barnett opened the door, called out
a cofiiipand and In & few moments an-
other big man in blue jumpera en-

“Yon are—?’ Rarnett started to
question the newcomer.

“The one you want,” chimed in tho

Frank going to make the trip?’ He

“Yes,” he spoke nervously. ‘Let's

Five minutes later Barnett and the-

“Tell your chief it's all right,” or-

on this endywill ever suspect. Now

It seemed to Frank Young, huddled
inside the poorty ventilated packing
