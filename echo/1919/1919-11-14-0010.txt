though, as the pamphlet says, “the
cost of seeds that is used in planting
a vegetable garden i8 small com-
pared with the returns,” the supply
of such seed this fall Is not likely to
be sufficient to justify any vegetable
grower in overlooking the possibili-
ties” that exist for saving a supply
from his own plats. ”

The pamphlet ig written chiefly in
the. interest of the home gardener,
and a table is provided showing the
amount of seed Deeded for an aver-
age-sized home Barden, the yield of
seed to be expected from an indivi-
dual plant or a 8%ven length of row
of plants,.the approximate number of
seeds per ounce anid the approximate
quantity of seed meeded per 100 feet
per row. Special instruction is given
with regard to the sawing of seed of
the following kinds of vegetables.
Beans, corn, cucumbers, egg plant,
lettuce, melons, parsley, peppers,
peas, radish, spinach, squash and to-
mato, and instructioms as to proper
storage of the seed for winter are.
given where necessary. Quantities
referred to can, of course, be multi-
plied to suit the case of any grower,
The following is am account of the
desirable form of practice ia produc-
ing, selecting and prreserving seed of
corn as given in thee pamphlet: |

It is quite a coommon practice in
Canada to save swieet corn for seed,
but many more prersons might do so.
Vapieties of corn are. very readily
crpssed, as the wiind blows the pollen

a considerable distance and the pol-
lén of one variety falling on the
silk of another fertilizes the flowers,

  
 
     
     
     
        
         
     
        
                
         
     
   
   
   
   
 
   
  
 
  

 
   
  
   

     
   
 
 

  
 

    
  

   

    

  

  
     

 

  
      
    
  
 

   
 
  

  
    

  

 
 
       
   

 
    
  

    
   
 

  
   
   
  
 

thus ensuring a cross between the
two varieties. . Unlike most other
plants, the-effect of the cross so far
as the appearance of the grain is
concerned is seen the same year, so
that if a black variety, such as Black
Mexican pollenizes a yellow. variety,
like Golden Bantarm, there may be
both black and yelliow kefnels on the
same ear, or there might be both
amber colored amd yellow kernels
should Early Malicolm or some other
variety with sammber-colored kernels
pollenize Golden Bantam. While, this
crossing makess the ear a little less
