with the muplipipality by, means of a
by-law, providing for certain finds
so tht the work of the Board of Trade
may not be interrupted from year to
year by changes in the” personnel of
the éouncil. Then we must have co-
operation among ° officers, members
and citizens. Membersswho «do not
put forth every effort along helpful
and constructive lines are no good.
Much work will have to be carried on
by special committees” who. stay on
the job.and bring projects to a suc-
cessful conclusion. © He outlined the
work of the publicity committee, and
the problems confronting the Trans-
portation Committee, the latter of

Major Tolmie, lately returned from
