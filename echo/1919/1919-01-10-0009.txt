very rough, not much interes: was
manifested in the vote. on the Good

who had faith in it and believed. that
it was a_ proper move, did no: show
their faith by good works, while op-
ponents to the scheme had strong

Harrow can count itsell very for-
tunate jndeed that the early Saturday
morning fire which totally destroyed
the Webster block, did not sweep .in
ita. path the buildings on each alde.
That the blaze was confined mainly to
the one place speaks well for the good
work done by the fire fighters. The
fire had grippe dthé whole upstairs
and was bursting from the front win-
dows when Colin Arner, who lives op-
posite, was awhkened and gave the
alarm. Soon the village was awake,
but not in time to save any of -the
effects of Ross Quick's barber shop
nor any portion of the building. The
flames broke through the - Masonic
