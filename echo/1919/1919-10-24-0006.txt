Anne Davis get out of it. She tugged

and tugged at the flywheel, but there !

was not even a buzz to reward her ef-
forts.

She looked down the river, vexed and
despairing. The boat was floating at a
fair rate of speed, and unless she
could get it moving In the other direc
tion before long she would have little
prospect of arriving at the Rest-While
cottage before dark.

Already it was dusk, but she man-
aged to make out something coming
upstream. Soon she heard the creak-
Ing of oarlocks and presently =n
shadowy shape loomed into view. It
was a rowboat with a man bending
vigerously at the oars.

“One ‘of the Inhabitants,” Anne de-
cided, but there was little disdain in
her voice. Meeting one of them in the
village she would not have favored him
with passing notice, but now any kind
of man’ would be welcome. She hailed
the stranger.

“Stop u minute, will you, please?”

He rested with his oars partly out of
the water.

“Did you call me?” he shouted, after
brief hesitation.

“Yes, I can’t get this old engine
started. I wish you would help.”

With some skill but much more difli-
culty he managed to get the rowboat
alongside the mdtog craft.

carly in the afternoon for Alanson,
feeling not a little conceited over being
the pilot and sole crew of the miser-
able little craft. The Culbertsons had
expressed misgivings over the venture,
but Anne generally had her own way,
and was possessed of a reputation for
heing a self-reliant sort of girl, so she
was allowed to make the trip alone.
Everything went smoothly. until she

Season was over and she was home
after a three weeks’ love affair that
started out frivolously and developed
into a very serious case.

“Well, I' won't ‘have it, that's al,”
her father insisted. “You aren't going
to disgrace the family like that. A
girl of your beauty can pick off a man
of money without any trouble.”

Anne bit her lip savagely and
stamped a foot.

“I don't want a man of money. 1
want Harry, and I'm golng to have
him or I'll dié an old maid with—with
a broken heart.” She left the room,
sobbing, and went and climbed into
her bed, where, bolstered by several
pillows, she wrote ia *“good-by, for
ever,” letter to Alanson.

Mr. Davis evidently was determined
to she that things went to his liking,
for the next day he came home with
the amnouncement that he had invited
his young law partner to the house for’
dinmer.

“You've heard me speak of White,”
he sald. “You know, he's been with
me iin business.for two years and I've
never yet got around to having him

an attractive young chap.”

Anne pouted In her room, but when’

| and straightened her hair and added
a few finishing touches of powder to

room. * It was just as well to humor
her father, she thought. It would not
do to treat his partner shabbily. ?
When she descended the stairs she
saw a slender, well-dressed, well-

intreductions were in order,
The next noon, at luncheon, her fa-

“Well, Annie, how do you like Mr.

She looked across the table with a |

happy little smtle and lifted her coffee
cup. After a few sips she placed it on
the table and replied:

“Fine, father. He and T are en-
gaged, We're to be married next
month."

Mr. Davis all but choked on a piece
of meat. He was forced to swallow

“Great heavens!” he ejaculated,

Sir Francis'Drake was “standing by”
to ald Britain's fleet, in case the hum-

take a final shot at the Unlon Jack,
before lowering Its colors, November

gr®it surrender: Along the British
ships was the Royal Oak; chiefly
manned by sallors ‘of Devonshire,
Drake's home county. The German
ships enme into sight absut nine o'clock
in -the morning, and immediately the
roll of a drum was heard, aboard the
vessel, Mr. Maclien writes, All aboard
were convinced it was “Drake's Drum”
of English legend.

Captain ‘Maelachlan ordered an im-
mediate investigation to find out who'
was absent from post, as thé ship was
stripped fer action. Every man was

The legend of “Drake's Drum” Is
that whenever England Is in danger

cessarily mean an increase in con

SOME WATCH HISTORY.

The first watches ever made were
as Big as soup-plates and as heavy as
they were cumbersome. -

The Emperor Charles V., for in-
stance, had ohe which weighed 27 bs.
The watches of that day, were very
much like ordinary clocks: They were
cylindrical in shape, finely, chased, and
had a hinged lid on one side to ex-
pose the dial,

A costly and elaborate witch Was
made for Sulton -Tbdul-Medjid by
Messrs. Hart & Son, of Cornhill, In
1844. It was made of 22 carat gold
and was 5” In dipmeter. = It chimed
the hours and quarters but was with-
out a bell, the striking parts being
made up of wires, It possessedsa
powerful and resonant tone, was ex-
ceptionally harmonfous, and sounded
like no cathedral clock. Twelve, hun
dred guineas was the cost. -
