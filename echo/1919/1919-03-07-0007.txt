CRUDE OIL REPORT.

—

The annual report of the Supervisor
of crude petroleum bounties, of the
Department of Trade and Commerce,
has just been Issued and Is of special
fnterest to all who are connected in
the oll trade of Wes*ern Ontario. The
past year has been one of the most
satisfactory for some S8essons, the re-
port shows a large Increase in produc-
tion over the previous year, In the
year 1917 the total production was
203,000 barrels. In the year 1018, the
total production amounted to 288,760
barrels, or an increase of 85.000 bar-
rels. The Tilbury district has shown
up well, having an increased produc:
tion of 15,000 barrels. The total pro-
duction there was 882,971 gallons or
25,277 26-35 barrels, One of the sur-
prising features of the report is that
the Belle River district in Essex coun-
tl produced 16,645 gallons, or 447 bar-
rels of oll. After a while when the
Amherstburg district 4s * thoroughly
