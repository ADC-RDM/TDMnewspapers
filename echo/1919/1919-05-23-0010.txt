German Guns.

A writer in an English. paper
gracefully deseribingathe  presenta-
tion of a couple of German guns to
a certain town, dwells. picturesquely
enough, on their introduction to a
couple of older guns, from one of the
old French wars, standing by the
doors of thestown hall. These guns,
he writes, were propably fired last
fn 1708, and then, droppimg like Mr,
Wegg into history, he speaks of them
as Turenne's guns. Well, In 1708
“Marlbrook” fought the Battle of
Oudenarde, so that if the guns were
taken then they must have been Ven-
dome's guns. * Of course, they might
have beon Turcene's first.. But,—
Turenne fell, {in 1675, at Sassbach.
A fact which makes the supposition
mildly improbable.

 

Look More Natural.

Behold father and son at the
photographer's:” Algy seated stifily in

him .at attention. “I think,” smiled
the photographer, “it would look
more natural if you put your hand
on your son's shoulder.” . “On the
contrary,” said Trotter, “to be really
natural, Algy should have his hand
In my pocket!"

Did Not Like to Change Words.

“Why de you object to the League
of Nations?” “On musical grounds,”
replied an American, “After singing
‘My Country, "Tis of Thee,’ all these
years, I don’t want the mental effort
of changing te ‘Our Countries, ‘Tis of
Those'."” , ‘ x es
