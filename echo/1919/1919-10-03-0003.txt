Every Summer our twenty-six stores rent hundreds of Pianos at the various resorts of Michigan and Ontario,

This

year, owing to the unusually long warm spell and the removal of war-time restrictions, more people than ever before spent the

number of Pianos. These instruments are now coming back to,us at a time when our warerooms are crowded with new stock

lection comprises mora than 700 spec|-
mens of silk manufactured by the de-
scendants of the Huguenots who get
tled In Spitalfields and Bethnal Green,
London, after the revecntion of the
edict of Nantes in 1085. It has lately
come |uto possession of the Interns-
tional Buyers’ club and is sald ta be
the most valuable of its kind In the
world, :

The fabrics of the collectign are as
durable and the colors ns brilliant as if
they were turned from the looms yes»
terdny. The disintegration of the sllk
fabric that one sometimes sees fn Ohl-
nese mandarin cents has not taken
place. ~ Jndeced, the old French silk
i workers did not develop thelr art from
the anclent Chinese, whos jealously
guarded the secrets of their craft.
The silk industry was originated In
the western, world by two Persinn
monks who hand resided in China and
who In about 550 brought to Constan-
tinople the eggs of the silk worm in
a hollow bamboo tube, From these
contents developed the silk industry of
Europe,

There Is an elusive dellency about
the French silks that quite defies de-
scription. Many of the French pat-
terns are quite up to date and are sald
te be In line for any revival of styles,
This Is particolarly true of the tiny
patterns In checks, blue, red, green and
brown In flelds of white silk, all of
which are adapted to cravats. The
"gorgeous colors are shown in the silks
of upholsteries; the most delicate and
evanescent In those evidently intend-
ed for women's apparel or draperies.
Wonderful dyes the ‘French weavers
used, vegetable dyes thut Increase In
their beauty as the years go by. , Gold,
pure yellow, brillant gold, is Shown;
white, ivory, flesh, coral, turquoise, Aap-
ricot, ocean green, ashes of rose,
chartreuse, honey, maple, geranium,
scarlet, cardinal, garnet and a thou-
sand other tints that would be hard
to match today even when we have
823 shades of navy blue alone. <

The strength and durability of the
silks In this collection, some’ of which
are hundreds of years old, suggest that
With reasonnble care they are proof
aguinst disintegration of the ages.
There Is not a cracked, worn or thin
sample nmong them. The brillinnce of
their dyes, some of whose formulas
are atypresent lest to the world, Is
evidence that the world may never
be forced to be completely dependent
upon any one: nation fer Its dyes and
that the forgotten lore In the art of

(| dyeing fabrics: reveals the varied fu-
ture that may be revived under the
spur of necessity.
