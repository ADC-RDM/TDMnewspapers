The Legislature has commenced ta

grent many important matters, how-
ever, remain to be dealt with before

in regard to the necessities ot the

ing the war. Mr. Atkinson impresses
upon the Government the nec2ssity
for passing legislation to provide for

fort and happiness of the people.

Dewart Charges.—arly in the week
tha Prime Minister announced the op-
pointment of Sir Willlam Meredith,
Chief Justice of Ontario, to invosti-
gate the charges made by H., H, Dew-
art, M.P.P. for S. W. Toronto, in con-
nection with the enforcement of the
liquor law in the Province, and par.
ticularly in regard to the allegations
against the conduct of officers of the
Government in the Homer Hquor case.
Petor White, K.C,, has been appoint-
ed to assist the Chief Justice in the
conduct ‘of the investigation. Mr.
Ayearst has been suspended pending
the investigation, and one of the re-
gults of the charges has been the re-
signation of George E. Morrison, a
provincial’, license inspector. The
Government is referring the public
accounts which Mr. Dewart wishes
Investigated to the Public Accounts
Committee.

Subsequent to the appointment of
the commissioner, Mr. Proudfoot, the
leader of the Opposition, raised cer-
tain questions in the House, aa fol-
lows: (1) Whether the appoiutment
of Sir William Meredith as a commis-
sioner “would come before the House
as- a motion for consideration; (2)
whether counsel, who may call wit;
nesses, will be allowed and pail to
represent the Opposition: upon the
hearing before the commission: (3)
whether the scope of the commission-
er's ‘powers has been more full? con-
sidered hy “the. Government; (4)
whether the commissioner's powers
Include an investigation into the ad-
ministration of the O. T. A. and the
enforcement of the law and matiers
arising out of or relating to tha con
duct of the liquor branch of tha de-
partment.

The reply of the Premier was that
the Government was issuing (he
Commission” itself and that no other
counsel. would be appointed exca2ot
Peter White to assist the Commission.
The Commission would only luveati-
gate the matters spacifically charged
by Mr. Dewart, and the Publlc Ac-
counts- Committee gould be an ave-
nue whereby Mr. Dewart could swcure
whatever information he sdught re-
lating to. the pccounts. Mr. Dewart
supported Mf. Proudfoot in: Lis de-
mand for“representation by counsel.
but {i [8 unlikely thet~this wills be
granted, »
“Blue-Sky” Legislation.

A bill to regulate the sale of shares,
bonds, etc, has been introduced by
the Attorney-General. The. bill ap-
pofiits a commissioner to examine into
the kind of shares which promoters
desire to place upon the market, It
{8 expected, however, that’ this bill
will falllithrough on account of the
opposition which has developed to It
throughout the country. The Attor-
ney-General said.that the prihciple of
“blue-sky” legislation had been en-
dorsed by a great number of compe-
tent. Judges but when it came to
drafting a bill the difficulties had been
found almost insurmountable,

NOTES.

The Government has at last accapt-
ed the argument of Liberal members
in” regard to permitting . women to
take seats ip the Legislature if elect
ed, and also permitting them to be
elected to municipal Joffice. At the
time of the passing of the Franchise
Act of 1917 giving women the right
to vote in Ontdrio Provincinl eizc-
tions the Liberals. emphasized the
logic of following this up by permit-
ting those new voters to represent the
people if so desired. The Liberals
could not suppress their mirth at
this fresh evidence of the. Govern-
ment’s péttiness in voting “down Lik-
eral proposals &nd afteryards adopt
ing.them as their own.

The. Government also introduced a
bill to enable farmers’ wives to be-
come members of school boards. -.

Estimates to” the tuna of over’ $3.

Joo were passed during the week.

Two interesting {tems were $10,000
forsmedical and dental inspection in
Public and Separate schools, and

{$214,000 for technical education. The

{tems were closely criticized but went
