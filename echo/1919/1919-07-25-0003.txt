The rain was pouring down outside
our room on the fourth floor ofthe
Zendine, and O'Grady and 1 sat play-
ing twosome bridge with dummy
hands. It was nearly three o'clock in
the morning. I was dealing to
O'Grady, who sat facing the windows.

“I never knew an Irishmnn In my
life who wouldn't try to lick every-
thing, even the worst animal that de-
lrlum tremens ever—"

O'Grady stopped short.

1 looked up.

He was staring at the window be-
hind me; and slowly and carefully he
began to pull ‘ont the drawer In the
table In front of him. We kept our
revolvers in that drawer. ¢

I stopped dealing,

“Keep on. Don't move,” he com-
manded softly.

The rain seemed to have stopped, I
found later that I denlt all the cards

Horrifled, we watched the thing

noticed now, was attached to Its

Then In a muffled growl, the head-

“But what did you do with this?’ I

lay on the table,

“That was my head. It wns cut
off in the jungles of Hunky-Foo, where
I tried to murder a gong of the world's
most famous scientists, Oh, you got
to give It to Tom. He was a big top
spleler. This was his stuff, I know it
by heart:

“Look! Look! Look! he'd yell and
hold up that skull.

“The crowd would come on the gnl-
Top. After a couple or three women
had fainted In the crush of people
who were afraid they'd miss a free
plite at something, he would begin :

"'While . searching for orang-

species of the beasts, abound, a party
led by Prof, Jules Le Pax, the noted
French scientist, of whom you all have
heard, came upon a huge, hairy being,
the Inrgest orang-utang the scientists
ever had seen.

“Like the enraged monster It wos,

safe return of the monster, and the
beast Is now “being displayed to ger-
