Whish There Is Record.

 

Papyrus on Which the Desires of Utah
Were Recorded Has Recently Been
Discovered in a Good State

of Preservation,
°

Utah, the Egyptian, looked ont
from beneath his shaggy eyebrows
across the Nile, where the eternal
| Pyramids shimmered In the heat
against the cloudless sky.” Gods of
Egypt! How dim were those -plles of
Stone! In the bright light of the sun
god, Ra, he should have seen those
man-made mountains clearly, *

Shades of his ancestors! His eyes
were dimming fast! He was’ getting
old—very old, so he suddenly realized.
He looked into the basin of the foun-
taln In the courtyard. The image re-
flected made him conscious, for the
first time, of lis swiftly appronching
end. He sank down upon the foun-
tain's rim and mused upon the short-
ness of life, Its varying fortunes amd
the prospects af the future life—ac-
cording toflie beliefs of himself and’
his fathers,

AD, ‘well, he was ready to dle. He
did not fear after death to take the
Journey with the sun god, Ra, in the

Jont of a Milllon Years to the Flelds
of Peace. No, by Amen, the god™of
Thebes! Had not Utah led a good
life?

Yes, he had always been just, mer-
ciful and kind to his servants and his
household. They had lncked nothing
while he Hved, nor had his wife, Shefs
tu, the daughter of Sat Sepdu; ~

But, after he was gone—ah, Phara-
oh, the great one who gives life to his.
people—would his memory be suffl-
cient to keep her from want or mis-
treatment? Would she ever be set out
of the great stone house as the wid-
ows of others had been In the past?

A chill, shagper evén than the ehill
of old age, shook him. _1It was the chill
of fear for his beloved.

Then a bappy thought warmed his
veins again,

The people of his household and his
city ever had listened and obeyed his
spoken and written word during his
life. His words by voice or writing
were considered nuthority and whole-
somely respected, © Doubtless, then,
would his written words be followed
when he was In thé Fields of Peace.
Strange, neither he nor anyone else
had thought of such a: thing before,

So with reeds, fluld and papyrus he
wrote in’ beautiful picture writing.

That happened more than 1,500
years ngo.. However, the papyrus has
kept In a good state of preservation
ull those centuries and was recently
discovered by excavators. Translated,
it proved to be the will or legacy of
Utah, allowing his wife, “Sheftu,
daughter of Sat Supdu of Gesab,” four
Eastern slaves gnd “the right to dwell
fn my house without allowing Her to
be put forth on the ground by any per-
som.”

The “will” {§ considered b
ties to be the first ever draw

Buttons and the War.
Buttons are not generally regarded
as one of the great articles of com-
merce, yet a report Issued by the fed-

Jem tariff commission presents some

astonishing figures regarding the mag-
nitude of the button, industry and the

capital invested therbin. 7%

There are more than G00 button-
anufacturing establishments In this
country, representing a capital of ap-
proximately $20,000,000 and an annual
payroll of $8,000,000, The unnual
value of the products Is more than
$20,000,000. New York has almost half
the factories, but the middle West sup-

“l plies most ef the fresh-water pearl.

The war bas put up the price of but-
tons, owing to the fdvance in the cost
of metnls used In button manufacture,
and the Increased price of celluloid
sheets and all subsidiary raw materl=
als, such as dyes, chalk, acids and can-
vagy, It 1s Interesting to learn thit the
war hos stimulated the business in
this country and has led to the manu-
facture of glass buttons, which former
ly were imported—another Instance qf
beating Germany at {ts own game.

A little old woman, wearing a wool-

little round hat, entered a surface car’

arms so filledewith a great bundle of

“We've got to conserve,” she sald
sheerfully to another woman who held
a seat for her. as she tumbled into a.
seat, mnking n dive at the same time

not discolored by wet weather, but
has the natural yellow color of ma-
ture brush, it commands about half
the price of good brush if cared for
in the same way.

Standard broom corn and dwarf
broom corn are harvested in different
ways. The standard is bent over of
tabled and the brush cut off; the
dwarf is jerkad or. pulled from the
dpright stalk.

The standard varieties are so tall
that the stalks have to be bent over
to bring, the brush within reach, This
process is called tabling, The tabler
walks betweenstwo rows, bending or
breaking the stalks over, three or
four feet from the ground. Theo
stalks of the left-hand row are hent
to the right and those of the right-
hand row to the left. This crosses
the stalks of these rows, so that a
sort. of table Is formed: behind the
tabler, the brush projecting across
the, table into the spaces between
this pair of rows and the next row
on either side. .

The brush is harvested by walking
