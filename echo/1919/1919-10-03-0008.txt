“Six or seven yemrs ago, I

Burgundy wines of 1915 mre report-
ed by the most eminent comnolsseurs
of Paris to bg the best since: 1885. In
fact their verdiet is “perfect.” +

The summer of 1915 ws hot, so
was the autumn, with light rains now
and agnin at exaetly the riight inter-
vals. 4M. Mathieu, celebratied savant
on the subjectiof wines, writies: “Since
1865 thére has been no Burgundy like
that of 1915 In delicacy or ‘strength.
The 1915 vintage 18 a remarkable syn-
