TOO NATURAL FOR
HUNS TO RESIST

An example of capital camouflage
ia given by Charlle Chaplin in his
second million-dollar plcture, “Shoul-
‘der Arms,” to be shown at the Liberty
Theatre, Amherstburg, on Friday and
Saturday nights November 14th and
15th, ‘when he disguises hiwmselt as a
tree stump, and starts on on spying trip
into enemy’ territory, qnly. t) be met
by a small party of Huns seeking
firewoad, who promptly decided to
| enop down the human stump as an
{addition to the load of wood they are
{about to take back to.thelf trenches.

In Charlie's opinion. his atiompr ut
camouflage Is entirely too successful,
and his rcaentment over the stupidity
tof the Huns in mistaking him for a
genuine stump gets him into count-
less difficulties.
