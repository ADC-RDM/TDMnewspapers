J. A. Leduc, M. P: for Wastmount-
told the cost of Hving committee = of
the House of Commons at Ottawa,
Thursday, that by conducting a “dash
and carry” business, and owning his
own abattoir, he was ahle to sell beef
ar a reduction of from 30 to 35 per
cent. On other prawiafons, by the
“ehsh amd carry” system, he-was able
to sell at from 25 to 26 pur cent.
cheaper. He had to keep only three
rigs instead of the 20 or more neces-
sary to a delivery business.

For, the best-roast of beef in small
‘cuts, he said, he had not yet charged
more than 30 cents per pound, Rib
roasts he sold for 26 cents; shoulders
15 to 18 cents; round roasts, 25 cents;
brisket, 16 cents; shanks, 10 to 12
cents. ro

One of the greatest causes of the
high cost of living, he said, was _the

telephone. ‘
"Mont people sdemed to think that

the highest-priced ment was the best, |

and the usual.order over the tele-
hone was for the highest-priced.
They did not know that as good a

roast could be got for 18 cents as for |

30 cents. \
. Leduc was satisfied with a profi

of 1 to 2 cents on butter. :

asked how to conduct a business eco

AID TO LAMB FEEDERS

able to get his lambs on the market in
good condition egrly in the autumn so
that they will mot have to compete
with the heavy runs of range lambs.

ens forage crops found to be of
advantage in lamb fattening are rape,
rye and clover. Rape has proven
quite profitable as a green forage crop
for as much as $86 an acre has been
secured from this pasture, an acre
carrying 22 lambs for 83 days and
producing 576 pounds of gain. Lambs
were valued at $15 a hundred pounds,
