Is Caused by Thin, Watery
and Cured by Enriching the
Blood.

Most people think of neuralgia as
a pain in the head or in the face, but
nenralgia may effect any nerve in the
body. Different names are given to
it when it affects certain nerves. Thus
neuralgia of the sciatic nerve is call
ed sciatica, but the character of the
pain and the nature of the disease
are the same. The cause heing the
same, the cure to be effective must
be the same. The pain in neuralgia
is caused by starved. nerves. The
blood which ‘carries nourishment to
the nerves has become thin and im-
pure and no longer does s9, and the
pain you feel is the cry of the nerves
for their natural food. Yon may
ease the pains of neuralgia with hot
applications. but you can only cure
the trouble by enriching and purify-
ing- the blood. For this purpose we
know of\ no medicine that can equal
Dr. Willams' Pink Pills. These
pills actually make new, rich blood
and. thus act as the most efficient of
nerve tonics, If you are suffering
from this most dreaded of troubles,
or any form of nerve trouble, give
these pills a fair trial, and see how
speedily you will be restored to good
health,

You can get Ir. Willlams® =
Pills from any medicine dealer,

boxes for $2.60 from The Dr. Wil
