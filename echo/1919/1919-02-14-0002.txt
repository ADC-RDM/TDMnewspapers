The drainage from the house was in bad shape, the cess pools having be-

five dollars. They are all comp and are giving fi lass service.

The hog pen should be overhauled this coming spring, as it is very cold
for winter use.
Owing to the high cost of everything, we are forced to request you for a
rease in salary. As you are well aware I receive six hundred and
ty-five dollars a year, which 1 could easily get working around here on

We are trying to do everything in our power for tie comfort of the old

tion could be self-sustaining, but while trying to work for your interests we
eel it our duty to look a little bit to ourselves,

All of which Is respectfully submitted.
