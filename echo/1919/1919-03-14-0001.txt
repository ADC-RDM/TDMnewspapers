“Wednesday evening Major W, W.
Shaver, District Inspector of Branch-
es, London, addressed a fairly well at-
tended meeting in the Library auditor-
fum in the interests of the Soldiers’
Aid Commission, branches of which
are being formed throughout thie Pro-
vince for the purpose of having defin-
ite organizations in each center \to:

Now that good roads are a definite
part of the program of all tie rural
municipalitiés in Essex couniy, it is
sdyely up to the urban connesting
municipalities to face seriously their
duty in respect to this importaut mu-
nicipal betterment, and not omly se-
cure information on what thelr rights
and privileges are under the good
roads system but get their money's
worth in local improvement for avery
dollar paid into the County Gcod
Roads fund, A few weeks ago, The
Eé¢ho called attention to) this marier
so far as it.affects Amherstburg: and
explained that during the past two
years’ Amherstbrug had paid into the
some 31409, for
which we can get no retur excaph
through the county, by-law under
which the Good * Roads scheme was
launched in August, 1916, and-that
provides for the return to each urban |W,
municipality, which links up any of its
connecting roads with the county
Roads system, of #he wholé amount
© | paid In and 40 per cent. additional
Govern grant. This means that
herstburg has now some- $2,600 to
its crédit In the County Good Roads
fund it can, get back by merely im-
proving that part of the ine be-
tween Sandwich strect dnd the town
limits fn accordance with the require
ments of {the Provincial Highway Act, |.
