INCREASED INSURANCE RATES.

A Toronto paper hag the following
query and reply fn the legal column;

E. W., Wellynd. —A was insured in‘a
fraternalgociety twenty-five years, and
fiad always Daid his acsesiments and
dues. The executive committee has
fncreaskd the assessment to over four
times the amount formerly charged.
‘Must these old members who are now
old men, pay these incrgased rates or
be squeezed out Of; the society? (2)
Would the court grant an injunction
restraining the reinforcement of ‘the

new nssessment or of tha expulsion of |

the old mén who cannot pay the in-
creased rates? "
. Ans—The firat question to he de-
cided is whether or not the increased
rates are authorized by the constitu-
tion and by-laws of the fraternal $o-
clety. You have hot sent me either
the constitution or* the by-laws and
have not even told me the'name ofthe
gocjety. I am mot at liberty to as-
surae that the society has deliberately
violated or ignored any provision of
“the Insurafiee Act,.or any restriction,
Vimitation, or condition -of its own
c er. (2) People attribute many
things to the “high cost of Nving’: it
might be as correct to say “the depre-
ciation of money.” A dollar-to-day ls
pot worth as much as fifty cents was
‘ eight or ten years Ago. If youn think
you have any chance y £an, com-
mence an action in the “civil courts”

10 restrain the directors ofthe society

from increasing the rates. and. for a

wdeclaration” that the by-law under
_whi¢h the increased. rates ore now
demanded, Is illegal or “ultra vires” of
1lié powers conferred upon the direc-

torate.

A MOTHER'S TRIALS

Care of ‘Home ‘and Children Often
Causes a Breakdown.

The woman at home, deep in house-
hold duties and the cares of mother
hood, needs occasional help to” keep
her in good health. The demands
upon a mother's health are many and
gavere, Her own health trials and
her children’s welfare © exact heavy
%olls, while hurried meals; broken rest
and much indoor living tend to weak-
en her constitution. No wonder that
the woman at home is often indisposed
“through weakness, headaches, back-
aches and nervousness. Too many
women have grown to accept these
visitations as -a part of the lot of

‘| motherhood. But many and varied as

her health troubles are, the cause is
simple and the cure at hand. When
well, it 1s the woman's good blood that
keeps her well; when {ll she must
make her bloodsrich to renew her
grate . The nursing mother more
jan any other woman. in the world

needs rich blood and plenty of iti:
There is one always unfailing way to

get this good blood so necessary to
perfect health, afd that is through the
use of Dr, Williams’ Pink Pills, These
pills make new blood abundantly, and
through their use thousands of weak,
ailing wives and mothers have been
made bright, cheerfdl and strong. If
you are ailing, easily tired, or depress-
ed, It is a duty you owe yourself and
your family to give Dr. Williams’
Pink Pllls a fair trial. What this
