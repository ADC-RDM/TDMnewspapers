SAD DROWNING.

 

The drowning of John -Anelo, ten-
year-old son M. Anelo, proprietor of
the American shoe repair shop; Mur
ray street, was about ‘the saddest
scene in Amherstburg for a long time.

    

  

 

    
 
 
  
  
   

     
    
 

       
  
   

   
  
    
  

 

he lost his footing and fell it. When
the younger ones had seen this, they
ran up the hill and told Mrs. M. Aw
‘|Wigle, instead of screaming for help
from the bunch ‘who were in swimming
at the ferry dcok, and in no time the
place was crowded with townspeople.
John’ Tierney, of tho Lake View
House; dove with all his clothes on,
but to no avail. When Capt. C. R.
Hackett, Bert Courtney, Harry Bailey
and others started grappling with no
suecess, 'F. Jo Trotter got out his div:
ing suit and Wallace Gibb went down
and found the child with a death grip
on an old mattress near the rocks in
about six feet of water which H.
Fox had partly pulled up with a pike
pole shortly after the lad went down.
He came to Amherstburg a year ago
with his parents, who are Italians, and
was attending St. Anthony's school.
The funeral was held on Saturday
morning to St. John the Baptist R. OC.
