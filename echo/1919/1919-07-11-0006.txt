   

AFTER EATING

! The Torturesof Dyspepsia
Corrected by “Fruit-a-tives"

Sr. Marmin’s, N.B.

“For two years, I suffered tortures
from Severe Dyspepsia. 1 had
constant pains after cating; pains
down the sides and back ; and.
horrible bitter stull’ often came up
in my mouth.

1 tried doctors, but they did not
help me. But as soon as I started”
taking ‘/ruita-tives’, I began to
improve and this medicine, made
of fruit juices, relieved me when
everything else failed.”

MRS. HUDSON MARSHBANK.

as every mother knows, that tend to
make her nerves run down. A change
would benefit her jaded system, and

“to give the nerves” a better tone. But
rest and change are often impossible,
