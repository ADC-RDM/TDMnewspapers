The Refinement of
Purity

AREFUL cooks know the value
of purity. - In the making of
cakes or pastry they use those

ingredients which they believe to be
pure and wholesome,  -

To apply this “insistence on purity”

to sugar, is no easy matter—far nearly
all Sugars look alike to those not ex-
‘pert in detecting variation. The'safe
course is to use a sugar that comes
from refineries in which purity i$ a
boast:

In the Dominion Sugar refineries
the boast js backed by a standing
invitation to the publie to visit and
inspect the plants in which Dominion
Crystal Sugar is made.

In Dominion Crystal Sugar the house-
wives of Canada have one sugar that can be

depended upon for that Purity which is so
essential to sucessful culinary effort.

This is the only eugar that may be rightly
termed. “Canadian from the ground up.”
We do import the finest raw cane sugar and
refine it—but our pride is in the product we
make from Canadiin sugar beets.
