The immensity and Strength of this

from the extraordinary assemblage of
stars secyred for the presentations of
this exceptional attraction,

“Stolen Orders” 48 a big picture” in
every sense of the word. It is grips
ping drama and it Is i spectacnlar
treat. The last reel in which a fight
In the car of a dirigible billodn is
staged and in“whichs the two combat-
ants tumble Into the ocean helow ds
one-of the most thrilling things ever
sliown on the screen. The rescue of
the «girl, by a liydro-aeroplane is an-
other one of the many thrills with
which “Stolen Orders” abounds.

Picture fans who remember Mr.
Brady's big picture success, “The
Whip," will be interested in knowing
that"in “Stolen Orders” Mr. Brady has
created an even bigger production
than “The Whip” and It is filled with
oven more spectacular scenes than |
“The Whip,” . :

“Stolen Orders” is a tromendously:

will long remember. x
