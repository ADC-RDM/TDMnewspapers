How MilK is Secreted.

No one knows exactly how the
cow sgeretes milk. Various theories
lave been put forth explaining the
process, bunt none of these aro .en-
tirely satisfactory. About all we
know is that milk fs a true secretion
f5the mammary glands located in
what-is known as the udder. more
commonly called the “bag” of the
cow. Tt Is made from Blood.

In order that the cow may have
plenty of blood, but of which she may
mannfacture milk. She must be ina
healthy condition, be s:pplied with
plenty of. pure air, and wHter and
have an abundance of the right kind
of feed.

Some cows are tnable fo maka
milk abundantly even though the
¥ner doef all ‘he can be expected
