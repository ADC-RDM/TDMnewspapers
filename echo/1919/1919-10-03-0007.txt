HE well {4 the usual source

of the farm water supply,

and a good well, that Is, one

which supplies plenty of
pure fresh and wholesomo water the
year round is certainly one of the
most essential and valuable asses of
the farm. Without {t no man could
live there for long, to say nothing
about bringing up a healthy family,
or building up an efficient dairy herd.
The well 1nust be there first and last
and all the time, and we cannot con-
celve of an Intelligent man buying a
farm without a good well if he in-
tended to live on It and make it pay
dividends.

Yortunately, most of Ontario's
farms are well supplied with water,
fn fact it is a rare thing to find a
farm where it could not be secured
in sufficient quantities by drilling to
reasonable depths, The supply, there-
fore, will probably never cause us
any sorious worry, but judging by a
recent on. analysis of many
well waters frony this Province one
seems justified In concluding that
there f8 still need for education of
the rural public In regard to the
protection and care of the farm well.
The following suggestions will be
found helpful to any farmer desir-
ous of making his water supply safe
against possible underground and
surfaco” contamination,

The first step in the solutlon of
this problem of purer water supply
is the location of the well. This
should be by all means om ground
higher than amy source of contamin-
ation such 18 barnyard, cesspool, or
outside privy. If there should be no
choice In location, and this cannot’
be done, chen the well should be
kept a considerable distance from
contaminations, + at “least 100
feet in clay, and 200 feet or more
in sandy soils, and_the cribbing and
