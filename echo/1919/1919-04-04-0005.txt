A

Bditor of The fuhq:—

The Lure of Harrow! The Bcho Is
always telling us that people love
Harrow so mich’ they = cadnot go
away, and If the should go away for
a visit they all cme back Inside of a
year. Now, why? Grand contest just
opened, everybody elcome, seats tree,
one year Echo mbiscription to lucky
winner. Who can best tell us: Why
they love Harrow” Is it because of
the pains and trouile you have taken
to make Harrow m good to lve in?
Do they like trench mud that makes
black spots on whit goods and white
spots on black? Do you love the
artistically untidy walks, alleys, and
even gome door yards? Or the bright
lights on moonligat nights? (Please
note poetry.) Do you enjoy the skat-
ing, concerts and entertainments that
are go attractively planned for the
younger people? Do yon adnire the
German style of trimming the trees?
Do you like our little park? Do you
feel pleased with our patriotic spirit
and the way our laws and by:lrws are
kept? Is Harrow such a picasa
homelike place in every respoct that
we just want cement roads so more
people can come, see and admire it;
or do we want good roads so as to he
able to go Quickly .past? I wondes il
the only reason we love to live ‘n Har.
row 1s because it Is like an old pair
of shoes? Shabby and untidy but so
very comfortable. No neal to make
an effort to kdep vour home clean and
tidy. Never need to cut the 57 varle-
tes of weeds that grow along your
sidewalk, "If you don't want to keep
the laws you don't need to, Nobody
will mind very much. You netd not
have any, feeling of responsibility
whatever because you are a cl’izey of
Harrow, March 27th. 1919.

 

    
 
   
   
       
     
         
       
     
    
      
  
 
   
   
   
 
   
 
  

 
  
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
 

    
   
    
   
   
   
  
   
    
  
     

Be sure you receive your own
favorite brand—*“Comfort”. Do
not permit inferior soaps to be
substituted. “Comfort” is the
biggest and best for the money.
For nearly 25 years it has. been -
at the top for quality, popularity
and big sales. So why buy ex-
perience instead of soap ?

One of the greatest shipments of
rubber ever received In America in a
single lot came across country from.
San Francisco to Detroit In. a special |
train of twenty-six cars, last week. |
‘The, weight of the shipment was 2.-
1 240,000 pounds The rubber was con-
signed, to the Morgan & Wright Stire
plant of the United States Rubber Co.
It arrived in San Francisco from Sing-
apore on the Siberia Maru on March
Ist, and represents part of the large
accumulations of crude rubber Held
back ‘In the Far East by the embargo
on’ importations. To the rubber ex-
pert a shipment of this size is a mat-
ter of amazement more than to the
average man unacquainted with the
infinitely slow processes by which
such stores of rubber “are built up|.
The shipment in question represents
the entire production of about 560,000
rubber trees for an entire year and
the labor of more than 1,000 men for
the same period. Every. working day
