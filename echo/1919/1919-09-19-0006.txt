“CONSTANT PAIN

Th Tortures of Dyspepsia
Corrected by “Fruit-a-tives”

Sr. Mammin's, N.B.

“For two years, I suffered tortures
from Severe. Dyspepsia. 1 had
constant pains after eating; pains
down the sides and back ; and
horrible bitter stull’ often came up
in my mouth.

1 tried doctors, but they did not
help me. But as soon as I started
taking ‘Fruila-fiyes’y IT began to
improve and this medicine, made
of fruit juices, relieved me when
everything else failed”

x Producers of Wealth,
Were proportional representation in
effect, and the electors voting only for
those of their own éllling, the farmers
probably weuld have 50 instead of 2%,
members. The urban population. in
Ontario is about 5 per cent. larger
thansthe rural, or 135,000 in a popula-
tion of two and a half millions. Were
Labor adequately represented It would
have at least twenty peats in the
House of 111 members. With the
agricultural workers co-operating with
the city workers, the producers of
wealth are likely to be much better
represented in the next Legislatare.
