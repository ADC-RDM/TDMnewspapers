Rheumatism

_, Bhoumatism has become so common
nowadays that hundreds of people
make no effort to rid themselves of ita
fatal grip, believing it to be incurable
savo in exceptional cases.

No greater fallacy exists. Sufferers
from rheumatism can be relieved if the
cause is remedied and removed.

Let us examine the facts. The direct
cause of rheumatism and kindred dis-
eases is poisoning of the blood stream,
through failure of the kidndys to filter
and romove the impurities that are con:
stantly collecting in the syste.

Onee the kidneys are out of order,
the trouble starts. The poison-ladened
blood circulating through the system
deposits its impurities in the muscles
and joints, setting up infection, and
Rheumatism, Lumbago, Sciatica, ctc,
follow.

The first step mecessary is to bring
the kidneys to perform their nataral
function once again, and relief will be
the immediate result. Gin Pills will do
it, and will save wooks of earful suf-
fering if taken at the first indications
of rheumatism.

Gin Pills have been recognized as an
assured relief to sufferers from rheums-
tism, backache, painful urination, brick |
dust deposits, and gravel. Thousands {

 

of testimonials bear witness to the fact |

that they relieve kidney or bladder |
troubles instantly. Try them. For sale
everywhere at 50¢ ao box. Gin Pills
cost little, but are worth a lot, Sample

LEAVES ALL TO LADY LAURIER.

Sir Wilfrid's Will to Dispose of Estate
¢ of About $160,000.

The late Sir Wilfrid Laurier's will
fs to be entered for probate withih ao
week. It is understood that'he left an
<state valued at about $160,000, and
that practically the sole beneficiary Is
Lady Laurier.

The estate Includes the revenue from
a Government annuity of $100,000 pur-
chased for him by friends some years
ago, residential property in Ottawa
and ‘Arthabaska Life Insurance: and
some stocks In Canada Cement, Mont-
“real Power, Montreal Tramways and
certain other companies.

LADY LAURIER HAS
F DECLINED OFFER OF )
GOVERNMENT PENSION

Has Been Left in Comfortable, If Not
Opulent Circumstances,

It j& understood that the Government
has tendered to Lady Laurier the offer
of n pemajon, and that ghe has declined
it. It would appear that Sir Wilfrid's
estate was of considerable. value, due
Jargely to the fact that some twenty

, years ago a number of Liberal friends
arranged for him an annuity of some
$5,000. Sir Wilfrid died in harness.
and had been drawing his sessional
allowance, and his allowance as lead:
er, which have been sufficient to meet
the demands of his simple life. The

annuity has therefore been practically

untouched, and has been accumulating
ugh careful investments. In ad-
dition his property on Laurier avenue,
which originally cost in’ the neighbor-
of $7,000, Is now valued at prob-
ably $40,000. ©

in .fassey Hall, Toronto, the other

A GOOV™ COMBINATION.

Live Stock Raising and Beets for

Sugar.

Sugar beet raising, combined with
thie keeping oi )ivp stock, is claimed
to provide a fii.rate means of build~
ing up a farming district; the feeding
value of the bee! pulp and tops pro-
viding In large minaure for the late |
fall and early winter feeding of the
farm cattle, and at (he same time,
for the restoring st fertility to the’
soll, while the rasts themselves pro-
vide a most spistactory cash orop
wherever Inter is procurable at a
reasonable pice, The thorough and
deep cultivition necessary for the
successful production of sugar beets,
which. could not be afforded in the
case of cpops of less money vadue, as-
sures a 8plandid condition of the soll
for other crops in the mixed or stock
farm rotation, while the extra labor
needed in beet cultivation on a small
scale, can be employed at other sea-
gons, to n considerable extent, where
cattle are fed for milk or beef, or
other live stock raised for the mar-
ket, as largely as possible

During the past year sugar bet
growing has extended considerably
on account of the keen demand for
sugar to take the place of the nor-
mal Import supply, held up by the
existing ocean shipping conditions.
Most of the undertakings in the
growing line have, however, been on

Belleve all for there are =a large scale and the live stock rals-

ing possibilities in connection with
the industry do not seem to have
been greatly considered. With the
increase in the labor supply, such 4s
can be expected as a result of peace
conditions, a general return to more
intensive farm practice may be fook-

| ed for; and with the resulting gen-

eral improvement in the condition of
farms in many districts, as regards
thelr fertility, the advisability of in-,
cluding sugar beets in the rotation
of the stock farm should be given
consideration.

Southern Alberta is indicated as a
successful sugar beet raising section,
the area suited to swch production
being larger than any two of tie
largeat producing sections in the
United States, and the product is of
high quality. 4

Tests made with beets grown un-
der irrigation from five different
kinds of seed at the Dominion Gov-
ernment Experimental Farm at Leth-
bridge showed yields of 173, 1634,
16% and 9% tons per acre, with a
sugar content of15.84, 19.42, 17.85
and 16.26 per cent., respectively. In
the same district, crops without irri-
gation yielded 9% toms per acre from
the same seed. In the irrigation
block east of. Calgary, beets with a
sugar content of 20 per cent, have
been grown in successive years, and
growers believe it can the maintained
as an ayerage over a series of years.

The only drawback fo the fmme-
diate extension of thm Industry In
Alberta i8 the lack of labor. Condi-.
tions of soll and climmite in that pro-
vince are sald to! be idea), but al-
most, if not exactly similar conditions
could be found in other provinces of
the Dominion, while, iin Ontario par-
ticularly; ‘the labor problem could be
more easily solved: . Besides; stock
raising as a farm undertaking, is an
industry sufficiently desveloped in On-
tario to present a very good oppor-
tunity for combining tthe growing of
sugar beets with the raising of cattle.

What Europe's Shortage Is,

The intest report am the shortage
of live stock in Europe was presented
by Mr. H. B. Themsmon, chairman of
the Canada Food Bamard, at the Live
Stock. Conference Iheld recently at
Ottawa. Mr. Thomson gave the con-
vention figures jusit received from
the Food Administration in London
ue to the latest officiinl estimates of
the live stock déficiiency. in those
countries of Europe lin which it has
béen possiblé: to’ prepare reports.
Including Great = Eiritain, France,
Italy, Denmark, Swewlen, Holland and
Garmany the total dedoit is: Cattle,
6,606,000; - sheep, 5,480,600,. and
pigs, 25,810,200.

For Austrin-Hungary no figures
are available, but the shortage is
ostimated as extremely serious.

In Britain there Is a shortage of
25 per cent. In hogs, and in England
and Wales sheep one year of age
and over have decreased by 11:3 per
cent. in the present’yenr, and. in Scot-
Jand there has been a decrease of
11.9% per cent.

Poultry In Storage.

The poultry markets are still un-
ga tisfasiory, Recelptis while. nol
larger than other years on record,
areé more than the pickers can com-
fortably take care of. Experienced
dressers are difficult to get, and stor-
age spice is scaree, The result is
prices quoted recently are materially
lower than thoge offered for some
time, Stocks of poultry in storage
iow Gre lerger than at the same date
a year ago.

Raw Material.

Prof. McVey, in his “Economies
of Business,’ says: “‘In order that
there may be production, It is neces-
sary that raw materimls be gathered
from the earth andl in agriculture
that an aren of ground be fertilized,
and that tools, organization and a
environment be gecured.
These are the necessities of produc-
tion, But the hwman factories are
still to be efciently applied.”

High Prices tor Breeding Sheep.

Record prices have been nssocint-
ed with most breexs of sheep in Eng~
land. The Romney Marsh has estab-~
lished a sale yard record of 1,000 |
guineas for a ram; the Lincoln has
obtained 700 gufmeas for a ram; the
