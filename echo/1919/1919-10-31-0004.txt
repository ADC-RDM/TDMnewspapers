President. Sec~Treas.

The Victory Loan now being offered
to the public fs a better security than
that sold in 1918, because the war is
over and the country fs, therefore,
not faced with the further, huge in-
crease in the National debt,” We have
it on the bes thority that not since
the Napoleokiic wars of riore than a
hundred years ago, has any country
of Canada’s present financial strength
offered to its people anything - like
such an altractivs Jssue as the present
Loan, In the opinion of high financial
authorities the fifteen-year bond will
sell at 109 or 110 within the next
three years, while the five-year bond
will also go to a substantial premium.
Sir Thomas White says “Organization
and work plus the patriotism and
business sense of the Canadian peo-
ple will make tile Victory Loan of
1919 as «conspicuous a3 any of its
predecessors.”

BYE-ELECTIONS,

Bye-elections to fill vacancies in five
Dominion constituencies were held on
Monday ang the results were as antic)
pated, U. F. O, candidates winning
three out of five of the seats. Liberals
won one and the Unfon Government
lost in every contest but one. The re-
sults in detail were as follows: Glen-
garry and Stormont, J. W. Kennedy,
U. F. O., defeated Brig.-Gen. Hervey,
Unionist. by 1,332; Victoria, B. C,, Hon.
Dr. J. S. Tolwmie, Minister of Agrical-
ture, (U.), defeated T. A. Barnard
(Federated Labor), by 2,100; Quebec
eat, Ernest Lapointe (Lib.), wus
elected by about 4,000 majority; Carle-
ton-Victoria, J. Caldwell (U. F.'0.),
defeated Col. Melville (Unionist), by
4,400; Assinibola, Gould (Grain Grow-
er) defeated Hon. W. R. Motherwell
(Liberal) by 3,727. The fact that the
Government has won only two seats
in seven bye-elections augurs poorly
for their chances when a general elec:
tion is held.

DRURY LEADS FARMERS.

For the first time in.jts history the
Province of Ontario is to haye a far-
mer for Premier, Several pames came
before the farmer and labor commit-
tee in caucus at Torontos Wednesday
afternoon. but the final choice fell on
E. C. Dtury, a prosperous farmer, re-
siding in the county of Simcoe, Mr.
Drury Is a son of the late Charles
Drury, first ‘Minfster of Agriculture (n
this province, and still lives on the
farm formerly’ owned by his father,
He takes the leadership of the new
Farmer-Lahor Government with the
fullest support of both parties, the
minor differences in the two plattorms
having been eliminated. Mr. Drury
has beep active in propaganda for bet-
ter farming conditions and for better
trade relations with the United States.
It is expected that there will be no
delay in-the formation of his cabinet.
Mr. Drury is 40 years old.

Mr. Drury is well known throughout
Essex county. A" few years ago he
was the principal speaker at a Grange
meeting in Malden, and madejq last
ing impression.

The resignation of the Hearst Gov-
ernment js expected in a short time,
and Mr, Drury will then -be called up-!
on; to form 'a Government.: It is ex-
pected that some leading Liberals will
unite ‘with the Farmer-Labor’ coalition
to. form a strong government.

DEFENDS ON LOAN

Steady Emplyment sod Prosperity
Hangs wm Victory Loan.

Canada's fuure prosperity depends
to a great extnt upon tho ucgess of,
tho Victory Lom. No country cam
exist upon tradewithin its own bdwn-
darfes. Canada counts on the trade
with Great Brinn and other allied
countries to kmp the tlood of good
times in the country. :

The surplus jroducts of the farm
and the factory find thelr way across
thé seas. The revenue of the farmer
and the mapuficturer 158 dependent
on this trade reutionship belag sus
tained. The employment of many
hands” depends on the orders that
come to the firm. The pay euvelope
only comes with steady employment,

Great Britain and overseas coun-
tries are stilt desirous of continuing
trade relations, but, overwhetmed
with war expenses, they must be
given credits for the time 9¢ing. The
farmer and the manufacturer musi
be paid for thelr products and mann-
tacfured articles In cash. Therefore,

jiCanada must nance the proposition
to keep the tide of commerce coming
this way. But in order to have the
money on hand to do this greal 1hing.
Canada must borrow from her people.

The Victory Loan offers bonds to
subscribers paying 5% per cei 1a-
terest. The guarantee behind the
bonds makes them an absolutely sate
investment. Victory Bonds are ac.
cepted as collateral at any bank. anu
can easily be turned mto money at
a profit. It ia then to the intevests
of every Canadiun fo subscribe fog
all the Victory Bonds he can, for 11

‘The Victory Loan of thig

and peace. The war is over, 3
boys won that. The recong

Much of the money that :
is asking for will be needed —
up the war debt. The expenses op
demobilization were heavy, and there
is still much of it unpaid. Now thie

that we repudiated the debt fop

The sick and wounded soldiers sty

hospital services must be maintained
at full strength as long as there are

soldiers in trades and professions
that they can earn a living at, and]
is following up the training and Boge
ing that they obtain réemunerative
employment. The maintaining of thi
branch of reconstructive service calls
for much funds, and the Victory Loan
will be used to pay for it as well ag
the other purposes.

Under the Soldiers’ Land Setfle
ment Act, enough money is lent te
returned soldiers to enable them to

buy and stock a farm. This money;
will be repald at a low rato of in.

change to re-instate himself in civik

Of the total amount of the forthy'
coming loan, $24,000,000 has been
apportioned to finance these soldier
farmers.

finance the credits to overseas couns
tries so that they may continue thelr
trade relations with ua, If Canada
cannot give these credits other coun.
tries will, and then Canada will lose
all that great overseas trade that hag
been the mainstay of our agricultural
and industrial life for so long.

As an Investment Victory Bonds are
eminent. Paying 63% per cent, sells
ing above par on the open market,
and guaranteed by the Dominion—
what further reason can you have
