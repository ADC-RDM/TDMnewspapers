of Deputies Monday, Premier Clomen-
cenu, after declaring that the League
| of Nations could exist even though
rejected by the United States, assert-

tions was an insufficient guarantep for
some years to come, that the protect |
ive treaties of alliance between
France, Great Britain and the United
States were drawn up.

At Wednesday's session of the
Board of Commerce In Winnipeg, Com-
missioner James Auld stated that eight
carloads of sugar had been turned
over by the Coca-Cola Company to be
sent wherever the need is greatest.
This sugar ls Testricted to fruit pre-
serving purposes only, and is’ not to
fill ordinary orders of the jobbers. Mr.
Auld explained in connection with this
sugar that the position of the Coca-
Cola Company had been generally:
misunderstocd. Its apparently ex-
cessive supply was due entirely to
its method of buying.

Valade sued the township for dam-
ages by reason of the overflow of the
Richmond drain. Late John Richmond
