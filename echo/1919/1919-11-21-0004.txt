Judge J. J. Coughlin. at Sandwich,
Tuesday, acquited deorge Smith, of
thig town, charged with breaking (nto
and stealing cutlery frori the hard-
ware store of W. H Richardson, of

this place. Evidence against Smith
depended on a8 unsuccessful endeav-

or of thé Crown to connect a state-
ment of the boy's mother, that. he
must have taken a pair of pincers,
which was missing from the home,
with the occurrence of the theft on
the same night. Smith was arrested
in Windsor the following day. Judge
Coughlin ruled that although the de-
fense had not entirely cleared the ac-

 

| cused from the possibility of suspic.

jon» yet the evidence of the prosecu-
tion was too flimsy to warrant a.cbn-
