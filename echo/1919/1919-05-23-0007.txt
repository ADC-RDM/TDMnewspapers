The heavy blow from the nartheast
which prevailed on the 9th and 10th
of this month, created havoc among a
large portion of the standing cedars
on Point ‘Pelee, The waves washed
over the low-lying banks and .carried
the cedars by the hundreds into the
lake, afterwards to be picked .up- by
the current and carried around the
Point. In addition to this many trees
hive been undermined and will no
doubt be carried away by the next
storm. The waves also washed drift-,
wood around the. dwellings on the
main part of the Polit, which they
were never known -to do before. Old
settlers on the Point attribute the
wreckage to the operations of sand-
suckers in removing the sand and
gravel bars in proximity to the Point,
which have hitherto been a protection

ONTARIO CREEDS.

What the Boys and Girls of This
Province Are Thinking. '

Aftor talking with thousands of
boys and girls. in rural districts of
‘Ontario, Dr, Creelman has drawn up

a fair representation of © what [8 in.* =

their minds, which he has embodied
in the following Ontario ‘boys’ and
girls’ creeds:

Boys' Creed.

L I believe that Iffe in the country
can be made just as pleasant and pro:
fitable as life in the city.

2, I believe that father and I can

form a partnership that will suit us
both, “-
3. I believe: that if I killievery weed
on my father's farm we shall be well
pald by the increased crop alone, to
say nothing of the benefit to our neigh-
bors.

4.1 believe that by careful selection
of our chickens 1 can double the out-
put of the flock.

5. I believe that by introducing alfal- ¢
fa on our farm that we can keep twice®
as many domestic animals as at pres-
ont.

6. I believe that by keeping twice
as many animals we.will be able to
grow:much larger crops of alfalfa and
other things.

7. 1 believe that by planting shade
trees, growing flowers, shrubs, and
keeping a tidy homestead we will. be
better contented and happier. in every
way, and our farm will increase In
value. }

8. I believe not In luck ‘but in pluck.

9 I believe that farming is & most
honorable calling, and having decided
to stay on the farm, it is my duty to
make the best use of my tim@ now. in
school, that 'T may be the better-fars
mer in the days. that-dre to come.

10. T believe® in - working when I
work and playing when play, and in”
giving and receiving a square deal in
every act of life,” ’

Girls’: Creed. >

1. I believe that I have a right to
be happy every day.” -

2. I belfeve that God's, blue sky and
€lod's green earth are a part of my
inheritance.

3.1 belleve that I have a right,to.
love “little; chickens and ducks "and
limbs and puppies and well as dolls
and ribbons.
¥ 4. 1 jpelieve T would love to keep
house better than anything else, and
only wish they taught housework at .
school. wm >

5. I helleve that keeping a garden
all my own would be great fun, and T
believe that I could be happy In giving
away flowers and in gooking the vege-
tables that I raised myself”

6. I"believe that Tecould study real
hard at my grammar and peography
and arithmetic and spelling if I could
do cooking or sewing with the other
girls-in the afternoon.

7.1 do not want to go to town, and
leave my father and mother and my
brothers and, sisters behind while I
live in the city, for I know I will miss
them all, and the trees and the creek
and the green'grass and the old woods
and everything, but, oh! I don’t want
to stay at” home and do nothing but
wash dishes and carry water and do
the chores, and-grow old liko auntie?
T-want to augh and love and live.

8. 1 belave: I can learn to sew and
cook and do" lmmdry work, and do
them well; and I want to learn them,
and T want to do them well.

9. I beleve In the square deal for

girls as well as boys, and I want evs =.

erybody to be happy all the time. —the ©
old as well as the young. .
