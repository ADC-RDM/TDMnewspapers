Dawn

By DOROTHY DOUGLAS

(Copyright, 1918, by thd McClure Newspa-
per Syndicate.)

“No,” Dawn sald, with regret and
finality equally blended with love in
her’ volce, “I love you as much as T
am cupable of loving any man, but yon
pave not the right’to ask me to give
up my friends. It is far better that
we consider ourselves free.” .

Harry Barrington looked back at
Dawn with pain In his eyes, A poln
thnt was perhaps mixed with a too
great darkness of jealousy. He looked
all that a man should be in his khaki
uniform, and he was sailing away to
| fight for* America’s liberty.

He glanced about the cool, home-
like studio that was Dawn's home and
realized that when he was In the
trenches fighting, his sweetheart would
be entertaining other men—that she
would be sitting down at the little tn-
ple dining tete-n-tete over a Dawn-
cooked chicken or a rarebit and glv- |
fng her smiles and her rare glances
to some one else,

“You know, dear,” he replied, trying
to persunde her to his viewpoint, “it Is
pot only jealousy—and Lord knows I
am that—but It {8 just common sense
I'm talking. Here you will be while I |
am away, and though you may be col- |
laboranting on stories and working your !
brain to tatters with Dicky Vane or
Ralph Reed, you are still Dawn Con- |
per, and therefore will be tempting
both yourself and the other fellow. |
Youn can't help flirting,” he'added. |

Dawn blushed, but her eyes were]
stendy and enveloped Captain Barring- |
ton with a glance that should have
told him that she was true as steel, |
with all her flirting.

“I'm sorry,” she said, “but women |

ii But In 0 way her big captain had
{| been right.

Life told her that she
could eusily have succumbed had she
bean less (rue to some nearer love.
Barrington, along with other men,
could perhaps not appreciate that she
was not Jlke other women In love,
Dawn loved love, but she also loved
her work. Shi wns generous and big-

ers to be the same,
The months flew past. Dawn
renched woriderful helghts of fame In
her writing and found a very level
i sense of contentment and happiness.
She had mapy friends and many who
would hays been more than friends.
| She begun to dress exquisitely. The
beantiful arms and shoulders were
even more lovely when set off by beau-
| tifnl gowns.

Then suddenly Dawn knew that

Captain Barrington had been brought
| back home wounded—wounded to the

point of being on that terrible preci-
|| plce that rears Itself between life and
| death.

She knew, also, that a considerable
| amount of skin-grafting was all” that
"might save his life. It was no time
! before Dawn had made her way de
terminedly to the surgeon in charge
of Barrington's case.

“And he must never know,” she in-

 

! gfinted, after having pleaded success:

fullly with the surgeon. The blood
tewit had been perfect. Dawn was
permitted to give many, many square
inches of skin from her wonderful
arms and! shoulders that Barrington
might live.

The operation was successful. Bare
rington, belng totailly unconscious,
knew not that Dawn's skin had been
grafted on his fivightful wounds.
Dawn's courage had! been marvelous
and her spirit felt greatly rejoiced.

She had done a smuill bit in the great

fight. |

No one in her Wig circle of friends
knew why Dawn sitopped wearing the
lovely gowns that: revealed her satiny
arms, and no one knew that Capt.

But, Dawn—I love you—I—"

“And I love yon,” she sald unstead-

“That-is in business,” he put In
quickly. .

“And so is mine business,” Dawn
stated, “but even if my men friends

When the hero was out of hospital
and able to attend it a big dinner was
given for him. Dmwn, of course, was
there, and her eyess were stendy and
held the old light lin them when she
and Barrington agaitn clasped hands,

“Dawn, Dawn,” was all Barrington
said.” His eyes told] her that life had
meant nothing to Jhim without her,
and finally- his lips: sald that he had
been wrong, al). wrrong in demanding
$0 much ‘of hur.

Dawn's smilie was radiant. She had

her sadly ; “you are perhaps not capa-

“I can't be the siave of love, if that.

“I am sorry I have disappointed you,
Dawn. Life would have been a very

When he had gone Dawn gave way
to tears, bot after that she braced up,

not to think of the void that Barring-

There were both depth and breadth
to her affection and complete trust.

SHIPPING THE LIVE STOCK.

 

Farmers Will Find That Co-operntion
Pays Them.

An ideal condition, as affecting the
live stock industry, would be the
existence of a large number, of live
stock shipping associations, all speel-
ally devoted to the shipping of only
the best possible quality of cattle,
sheep and swine,

Co-operation by farmers in ship-
ping live stock ‘to market has proved

80 sucgessful up to the present that |

the method, is certaln to be very
widely adopted in thé near future,
As It will, no doubt, hecome neces-
sary for a newly-formed association
to make special effort to attract at-
tention to Its offerings in case of co-
operative shipments from definite
communities becoming general, and
as price cutting will be out of the
question under the co-operative sell-
ing arrangement, puperior quality
will have to be depended on to make
| the stock from a particular district
=| specially popular with the buyers.
So far, co-operative selling of live
stock has shown fits superiority over
individual disposal of animals to the
drover only in the benefit derived
from economy In small detafls of
business, and it yet remains for soma
particular co-operative selling asso-
ciation to show what can be done
through the careful selection of all

  

up their carload lots,

The process of gecuring a large
membership in an association which
would enforge, for instance, a rule,
that no butcher’ cattle would be ac-
cepted Tor shipment that donot show
promise to yield at least a 500-pound
carcass, but the association adhering
to such a _rule.would prosper ultl-
mately, and if {tF roles were extend-
ed to demand hogs only, of "between
185 and 0 poundsy¥ of the" bicon
type and properly finished, the suc-
cess of the association would be even
greater.

The live, stock Industry of tind
country must‘depend, for the futures,
on.export business, Already the hold-
Ings of stock in the hands of the
farmers are beginning to ghow nn oo
precizble Inerease despite war condi-
tions; that Is to say: Good cattle
‘have increased despite war conditiona
while the holdidgs of poor-class anl-

mals have increased, largely becadse

war conditions exist, "War conditions
have forced the practice of economy
upon the mass of* consumers, with
the result that the poorer ones, finan-
cially, will not indulge in unecono-
mical cuts of beef or other meats, and
it is a foregone conclusion that the
inferior class of beef cattle and other
stock Intended for slaughter will
have to be disposed of at lower rates
than, thoge' now existing for such
. material. :

Economy. in beef, carcasses is re-
cognized and insisted on by the pur-
chasers of supplies for overseas, ns
indicated by remarks of the Minister
of Agriculture recently and the Min~
{ster's appeal to farmers to finish
their tattle to a reasonable: point Is
worthy of consideration, not only in
view of the existifig army demand,
‘but also with regard for the civilian
demand which’ is developing out of
a more general understanding of
what pays best In the way of beef
for nourishment. .. ;

It simply, cannot pay to produce
canners and cutters on the farm at
present cost of labor, even with sell-
ing prites as they have been'this year
and {f a farmer's breeding stock of
cattle is of the kind that gives only
animals of inferior quality — bad
doers and poor type individuals—the
sooner he ia out of them, even ata
low price, and into some good strain
—oven at considerable cost to start
with—the better .for his very near
future, because, only the good one
| fn tho beet class will be wantéd very
shortly, and the same requirement
is due to apply In the case of all
farm animals for meat supply.
