“What ship did you come on?’ asked
the birdman, realizing already that he
was more than glad to know Betty and
her brother. He was discovering the
wonderful charms that had been hid-

dissatisfied now to hover so far above
Betty and her garden.

SEW FOR ITALIAN REFUGEES

Another Illustration of Splendid Work
Being Done by the American Red
Cross in. Europe.

A letter from Red Cross headquar- |
ters at Rome, quoted by St. Paul Plo-
neer Press, says: -,

“Great gucces§ has attended the
operation’ of ouvrolrs, or sewing rooms,
for the benefit of women refugees and
the poor women of soldiers’ families
in Italy; These ouvrolrs, ~established
by the American Red Cross, afford em-
ployment to thousands of willlngswork-
ers, who thereby are enabled to make
money to maintain themselves and at
‘the same time supply clothing to oth-
ers of thelr own class at about one-
third the usual price.”

The Initial sales of the products of
the ouvrolrs at Padua and Taormina,
Sicily, were gala events In the lves of
the afflicted refugees. For hours be-
fore the sale opened at Padua long
lines of women awaited thelr chance.
Each person wig allowed to buy only
a given amount. There was also cloth-
ing for men and children.

Concerning the frst public sale at
Taormina, 8 Red Cross worker in
charge of the 6ewing room wrote:
“The women, mos of them barefoot
and pitifully ragged, filed past me to
recelve for thels two and one-half lire
(about 35°cents), the fresh) not to say
pretty garmenis made by the workers.
One womny wore a dress of sacking.
Each was alltwed to choose her own
dress and ead received besides the
dress a chiiige of underwear, and, as
long as the stockings we had on hand
held out, a pair of stockings. The
children psecelved two dresses and a
change of underwear, and the old men
shirts any underwear.”
