I - ' The Strain of
Overwork

Your work is heavy, afd sore, tired
muscles are & common occurrence.
Each time your back aches you blame
» . it on your work, and just. there the

danger lies—for that pain in the back

may not be from strain, as you sup-

pose, but the forswarner of Kidaey or

Bladder trouble.

For your own interest, it is best to

¥ be particular and sure, as Kidney

troubles inevitably pull you.down and
destroy your carning power.

‘Take note of these symptoms. Do
you getidizey and have repeated head-
aches, painful urination, brick dust de-
posits, or feel drowsy and, generally,
good for nothing? If sg, it is your

, kidneys that are bothering you—not

Catholic College of Maynooth: receiv.
ed the King, who was welcomed by
the bishops. This, according to Mr.
MacManus, caused George Moore to
withdraw his patfoppge from the
Roman Catholle Church and become
an Episcopalian. In this connection,
Mr. MacManus says that Mr. Moore
announced Nis intention In a letter
to the Protestant Archbishop of Dub-
lin, who not happening to know Mr.
Moore from Mr. Smith, expressed
gratification at his decision and told

him to apply to the rector of his
parish. This Mr. Moore, ‘some-
what taken back, did;s but the

rector was also in ignorance of his
fame, and told him to write to his
curate, who would @ recelve him.
The hardworked . curate received
the“letter and informed Mr, Moore
that if he would appear at a-certain
place on a certain day he would be
properly received. He also told him
to*apply at the office of the Evange-
lical Society, where he could get a
palr of blankets, and also a dally
handout of soup. We believe that to-
day Mr. Moore is a staunch Episcos
