Joseph Maisonville, a well-known
former resident of Windsor, died, at
his home in Creton-in-the-Hudson, New
York, of dilation of the heart. Mr!
Majsonville had made his home in the
east for the past 26 years. Previously
he was the owner of the Eureka hotel
on Sandwich street east, and before
that he conducted the old Beeman
house, which stood on the east side
of Ouellette avenue at Pitt street, on
the site of the Royal Bank building.
