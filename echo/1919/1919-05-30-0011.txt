ONTARIO WOOL CLIP
IN" GOOD CONDITION

 

Very Little Waste in Lots Received
at Grading Station.

 

The wool’®of this season's clip re-
ceived atthe'Guelph Central Grading
station of the Co-operative Wool
Growers’ Association up to the middle
of last week amounted to nearly 100,-
000 pounds, and of §0,000 pounds that
has been graded the wool has proved
up to the following grades Fine med-
jum clothing, 8 per nt.; medium
clothing, 3.09 per cent.; fine medium
combing, 3.1 per cent.; medium cloth:
ing. 29.6 per cent.; low medium cloth
ing, 29.0 per cent.; low combing, 14.9
per cent.; coarse, 13.8 per cent. This
leaves only 5.2 per cent. of the mater-
ial graded in the classes for rejects,
tags and waste, showing that the clip
so far. is in good order and of high
quality, with a good percentage of the
more valuable grades of average do-
mestic wool.

Last year 750,000 pounds of wool
was graded at the Guelph station and
sold for half a million dollars. This
year the price will be somewhat low-
er no doubt, but it Is expected that
the increase in consignments will be
sufficient to bring the total sales rg.
ceipts up to last year's figures. She;

ODD FELLOWS GATHER
AT AMHERSTBURG
\ a .
Fraternity Exemplifies Four Degrees
Single Day—Largest Gathering In
Western Ontario in Many Years—
Grand Master of Michigan Present

 

Providence smiled on the celebrities
and exemplification of degrees work as
the time for opening their Lodge of
Instruction approached on Thursday
aftérngon, and a more Ideal day could
mol have been had by the members of
Rose Lodge No, 28, 1LO.O.F, for their
big lodge of instruction, which was at-
tended by Odd Fellows numbering 600
or 700 from all parts of Essex and
Kent counties,

The roads were only In fair éondl-
tion due to Tuesday's rain, but at noon
automobiles started coming into town
from ‘all directions and there was a
continyous string 'of cars until well
after 8 p.m,

Four degrees In Oddfellowshlp fra-
ternity were exemplified in the town
hall, the 1.0.0.F. home being far too
small for the work. The Initiatory and
Pirst degrees were conferred by the
|Bssex and Walkerville lodges, re-
spectively during the afternoon, and
both excelled themselves in the work.
Lunch was served to £00 Odd Fellows
from 5.00 until 10.30 pm. in the I. O.
O. F. hall, which was a monstrous
task, but the members had the volun:
tary assistance of a score of ladles,
|and the wants of the inner man were
duly supplied In as good a manner as
it was possible .under the c¢ircum-
stances, and there was very little
cause for compaint.

A large number of the brathers re-
turned to their homes after supper,
but others eame to take their places,
and it is conservatively estimated that
when the Windsor degree staff was ex-
emplifying the Second” degree, that
there were fully 600 members in the
| hall,” which was packed to capacity,
|every chair being occupiéd . and the
gallery crowded to overflow while
many stood in the main portion of the
hall,

The work of the Windsor second de-
gree staff was impressively dramatized
with special lighting and scenery, and

 

at 945 p.m. they gave way to
the third degree staff of the
Leamington Lodge, . who did them-

selyes proud fn upholding their fame,
which fs highly respected and honored
in Odd Fellowship throughout the en-
tire Province,

At the conclusion of the, degree
work, the D. D. G, M. of Reid Dis-
trict. No. 1, Eccles J. Gott, ‘who was
Master of Ceremonies, introduced for
the first time in an Amherstburg
lodge of Odd Fellows, George Harland.
Grand Master of the State of Michigan.
The Grand Master of Michigan, at the
very outset of his wonderful address,
won favor with the Canadian broth.
ers in the respect, he paid to the gal-
lantry of Canadian Oddfellowship, ny
the glory they attained for their coun-
try and fraternity, in the noble stand
they took in the European conflict,
when ong man out of every ten be-
longing to the Independent Order of
Odd. Fellows: fn the Province of On:
tarfo responded to the call to uphold
the traditions for which they stood as
a fraternity.. Had Gérmany been adu-
cated by Oddfellowship, had Oddfel-
lowship gone Into Germany and perm-
ented the very soul of the mation as
it has done in the United States and
Canada, the world would not have
been called upon to face the atrocities
and human sacrifices as had been
done. “An Odd Fellow cannot draw.a
sword , againsts a brother,” said Mr.
Harland. amid rounds. of applause.
How many Qddfellows were thare din
Germany at the outbreak of hostili-
tles, asked the speaker, which he ans-
wered by saying less than 7000; while
you in the Provin®e of Ontatnjo,” with
about 1-40 the population of Germany
possess a menibership of over 50,000.
He characterized the Kalser. ahd his
Potsdam gang as people who-had ev-
erything a heart could honorably de-
sire, but to-day finds him an_‘exie
withouta country, and his dream; of a
worldwide empire shattered, and his
own ‘people shouting “Down with the
Kaiser.” He pleaded that Oddfellow-
ship might set an example or bind:
{ng the pegple of the United States
dnd Canadaveloger together in the ties
of ;moral cansanguinity, and, that no
phrase of {ll feeling will be used by
an Oddfellow of ejther country which
would be detrimental or. dll reflecting
onthe. people or gove
other country. Mr. Harland, ‘though
not a Democrat or in any way a sup-
porters ot. Woodrow Wilson, yet he
stood solidly for the principles of Odd
Fellowship which are involved in the
League of Nations.

“Brothers,” sald®Mr. Harland, “there
Is an0dd Fellows wave sweeping the
entire universe, because the brothers
are becoming more earnest in their
lodge work, and are throwing ‘the
goat,” which all candidates fear most,
entirely out of thelr conversations and
lodge, and are pronouncing the fact
that Odd Jellowship is founded upon
an eternal principle, and that their
guide is the Inexhaustless fountain of
God's truth, He closed a most inter-
esting ‘address with the hope that his
next visitito Rose Lodge was not fag
distant. A

At 12.16 a.m. Friday morning; it was
announced that the special cars which
conveyed the Windsor and Waiker:
ville brothers were ready to leave,
which momentarily disturbed the
gathering while 200 members retired.
The Rev. Mr. Hibbert, N. 'G. of Essex
Lodge. was then introduced in Odd-
fellowshop for the first time in "Am-
herstburg, and delivered an eloquent
and instructive address, He was very
well recelyed. 2 =
Past Grand Master Brett, of Essex,
whom Rose Lodge always claims,
made some nice remarks, followed by
the Daddy of Odd Fellowship in On-
tarfo, S. McGee, who has been a mem-
ber of the fraternity for 63 years, and
is still one of the most active members
of Rose. Lodge. Short addresses by
‘Captain Roach, of the Leamington De-
gree team, and John A. Auld brought
the reception to a close, and the cur-
tain was drawn on one of the most
successful gatherings of Odd Fellows
ever held in Western Ontario, and the
