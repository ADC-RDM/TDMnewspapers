THE-LATEST CANADIAN LOAN.

~~

 

 

,Canada Is in the market for another
* Vistory loan. The money is to be
used mainly to meat obligations she
is about to contract, The first of
these, the démobilization of her army,
the transportation of her soldiers to
their homes, the care of the sick and
wounded, the re-education of the dis-
abled and the. maintenance of dis-
charged men until’ they have an op-
portunity to find suitable employment
ia expected to cost her-about $260,
000,000. ‘This is a heavy charge for a
country with a comparatively small
population, but it is a debt to the men
who ‘offered their lives for her. And
it is better that it should be paid than
that discharged soldiers should be al-
lowed to drift into the army of tramps,
and that sick and disabled men should
be left to become objects of chariis.
The money that is spent in making
them self-reliant and self-supporting
will be well repaid.

Another $57,000,000 is required to
settle dsicharged soldiers upon the
land. Every soldier who has the ne-
cessary capacity for the work is pro-
vide with a farm, animals. {mple-
ments, etc. and pays for them by
small yearly instalments. The loan
becomes a first mortgage upon his
praperty until it {s all paid off. This

country in several ways: IU will pro-
vide immediste work for the men, it
will increase the production of food-
stuffs in the country, and it will re
lieve to some extent the congestion
of the cities, It is a plan that has
everything to commend it.

A goodly part of the proceeds of the
loan will be devoted to what is termed
national working capital. The Gov-
ernment realizes that trade with Eur-
opesan countries,” and with those of
South America as well, cannot be car-
ried on at the present time except on

: PELEE ISLAND.

As the date of the tmiat® of sarad-
Buckers vs. Pelee Island approaches
* the time set, December 1st, a trial in
which Pelee stakes herzall, this trial
has been aside through the agency of |
a powerful foe of the island, but now
the day is set and we are now looking
for help from the Dominion of Canada
Jn general to save what is left of our
“~ beautiful island. We are naturaily
looking for a strong support from the
ranks of the U. F. O., who. lik¢ oar-
«kelves, are looking for better repre-
santation. It Is very true we did not
support the U. F." 0. candida*e very
strongly, for one reason we were left
entirely in the dark a3 to what the
body stood for, .and~ another reason
was that we have had farmers repre-
gent us before. and when we wen: to
the Assembly he conld not be found,
bit to-day, Brother Fafmers, we are
-supplicating you for your strong. sup-
port, not only strong but o nth. square,
<a body who will see justice done; and
we expect, and don't want anything
but a fair deal. Pelee Island to-day
stands on the brink of destruction.
Her low lands,” which are the most
fertile lands we have, were inundated
\ to the depth of from six Inches to a
3 foot last spring, and it was only the
hand of Providence: that calmed the
waves and saved the Island from total
destruction. If the Government will
not stop this outrage. then by all
means buy it out. Our homes and
lands are at the mercy of thosé sand
dredges; they have already done dam-
kge up to hundreds of thousands of
dollars and are still taking away our

. shores at an alarming rate. Take
from 8 to 12 vessels, their carrying
J capacity being 600: tons. loading daily
slong our shores, and ask” yourself
what the eventual outc me . will be.
it cannot be anything else’ but de-
struction, and that in the next year.

Station, according to Supt. D. D.

heads and grow his own-tobacco seed

methods,

In selecting seed plants, the whole
field should be gone over several
days before topping, and, with a
fixed idea as to the type of plant
best suited to his soll and climate
Land most desirable for his market,
the grower should select about twice
as many plants as he requires, The
plants selected should be typical of
the variety of tobacco grown, early
d vigorous. It is also important
to take into consideration the num-
ber, shape, size and uniformity of
the leaves; the time and uniform ity
of ripening, the“numbeg of suckers
produced, the color of the leaves at
the time of ripening, and, if pos-
sible, the color of the cured leaves.
After ‘the preliminary selection, the
field should be gone over several
times, and any plants showing un-
desirable characteristics discarded.

Tobacco is naturally a self-fer-
tilized plant, and ordinarily does
not cross. However, bees and other
Insects flying Trom one flower to an-
other will carry the pollen from one
plant to another; and if a poor plant
or one of another variety should
bloom out near the selected plants
there Is danger of them being cross-
ed, and the benefit of the selection
lost, unless the aeed head Is pro-
tected in some way. Just before the
first flowers open, each seed head
should be trimmed up until only the
five top branches remain. This. in-
sures the grower obtaining the seed
from the earliest lowers which form,
and the plant food which would be
distributed over the whole seed head,
were it left untrimmed, is reserved
for the development of the earlier
pods. The seed head should then be
covered with a fourteen-pound ma-
nilla bag, the mouth of which is tied
loosely around the stalk just below
the lowest remaining branches.
About every two weeks these bags
should be removed, all suckers and
late pods broken off, and then re-
placed. After all of the seed pods
have formed, the bags should be re-
moved, and the pods allowed to ripen
in the open. This will cause the
seed to ripen earlier, and give a bet-
ter germination test.

When the greater portion of the
pods have turned brown, and before
any heavy frost, they should be har-
vested and hung in a dry place for
about two months to fimish ripening
and to cure. After this they may be
hulled. .

In storing tobacco seed, care
should be exercised to put them in a
dry place, and in a container. into
which the air can penetrate. It:ius-
ually requires from. 25 to’ 30 seed
heads; trimmed up as previously
described, to'produce ome pound of
seed.
