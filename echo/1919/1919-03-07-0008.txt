spoken of at Liverpool is a maximum

criticized the Government for its: fail-

matters in the Speech from the
Throne. Some of the matters suggest-

soldiers in community centres; that
the Government should appoint a Min

question by appointing a Superinten-
dent and then a Deputy Minister, when |
later on they would be obliged to
create a full Department. Mr. Proud-
foot also constructively criticized the
question of education. He urged the
introduction of a Faculty of Commerce
into the University, commended the
Government for adopting the Liberal
policy of giving women seats in the
House, and urged careful considera:
