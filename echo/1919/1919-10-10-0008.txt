Time, Makea Short Speech Which
Will Be Preserved.

Thomas A. Edison, who Invented the
phonograph 42 years ngo, hus for the
first time consented to have his own
voice recorded on a phonograph ree-
ord. The reproduction, which Is on
the back of a record containing the
national anthems of our allles, was
heard recently for the first time In the
Edison laboratory at Orange, N. J.

Mr. Rdison gelebrated his 72nd birth-
doy on February 11, The talk, which

fa Mr. Edison's first comment about

the war since America entered the
fight, follows.

“Our boys made good In France.
The word ‘American’ has a new. mean-
Ing In Europe. Our soldiers have made
It mean courage, generosity,  self-.
restraint and modesty, We are proud
of the North Americans who risked
thelr lives for the liberty of the world,
but we must not forget, and we must
not permit demagogues to belittle the
part played by our gallant allies.
Thelr casualty lists tell the story.

“However proud we may be of our
own achievements, let us remember al- _
ways that the war could not have been
won if the Belgians, British, French
and Itallans had-not fought like bull
dogs In the face of overwhelming
odds. The: great war will live vividly
in. the minds of Americans for the
next 100 years. I hope that when we
do reverence to the memory of our
brave boys: who fell In France we
shall not forget thelr brothers in arms
who wore the uniforms of our allies.

“I belleve ,that the national airs of
France, Great Britain, Italy and Bel-
glum should for all time to come be as
familiar to us as our own ‘Star-
Spangled Banner.'"”

BRIDAL FLOWERS HERE AGAIN

That Orange Blossoms Are In the
Market (s a.Sure Harbinger
of World Peace.

One interesting sign of the coming
of peace has been the reappearance, of
real orange blossoms at weddings.
During the war they were difficult to
obtain, owing to the fact that they
come as a rule from France. Nearly
all the orange flowers which are used
at smart marriages in London and
Paris are grown In the sheltered val-
leys of the Alps Maritimes behind the
Riviera. 3

Here there are orchards of orange
trees scattered over thel sunny slopes,
2nd the jocal peasantry devote most of
thelr time to growing the beautiful.

the fruit, seeing that the orange treea
are solely cultivated for the sake of
the glisténing blooms.

A large part of the flornl crop finds
its way to the perfume factories ‘of
Grasse, but the choicest sprays are
picked for the London and Paris mar-
kets. Orange flowers keep fresh for a
considerable time, and they stand the
journey to England very well, arriving

A pretty girl fluttered over to a

row some writing paper. . She had an
important letter to. writs and mall,

half an hour’ later she returned for
an envelope, and ay little later still
