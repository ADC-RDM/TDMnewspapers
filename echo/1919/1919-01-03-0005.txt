ENEMY PROPERTY IN CANADA,

\

A atatement has béen Issyed by thé
Dominidn Government reviewing its
activities In ‘enforcing the various
regulations respecting enemy property
Jand enemy business dealings in’ Can-
ada, It Is pointed out that since the
consolidated orders respecting trading
with. the-enemy were passed, the De.
partment of the Sefretary of State
has made numerous investigations, ‘in-

property or dealings which have been
brouglit to its attention. In many in-
stances” chartered accountants have
been engaged to investigate and sub-
mit reports, and among the list: of
firms- whose businesses were thus in-
vestigated are.the,different companies
in which Alvo von“Alvensleben, of Van-
couver, was interested.

In atldition, the Finance Department
has been engaged In carrying out the
| provisions of the orders, in collecting
[menexs, registering enemy properties
In Canada and clafms of debts due by
| persons in enemy countries to Can-
ddians, and vice. versa. These claims
[ere now being dealt with by the Enemy
| Debts Committee, and particulars of
the claims are being forwarded to
Canada’s representatives at the Peace
Conference. :

 

 

SMALL SAVINGS DESIRED.

 

Desplse not the day of small things
—1s the advice the soundness of which
has always been recognized. In na-
tional fihance this holds es true as in
other departments of life, So one sees
the nations generally making it CARY
for their people to save because It is
{redlized that by the savings of the
masses the national financial edifice
may be made secure. The Dominion
Government has launched a War Sav-
Ings plan that {8 framed to promote
saving among all classes of Canad-
fans. By this method money may be
lent to the Government through the

purchase of a War Savings Stamp at

$4. for which $5 will be repaid by. the
Governmery, in January, 1924. This
menas at money, thus . invested

draws V4 over 414 per cent. com-
pounde yearly. As behind these

Canada, one can
readily see that the security -is un-
questioned. If Canadians do not be-
come a saving people ft. will not be
through Inck of opportunity, or {nduce-

ment, to save. v
