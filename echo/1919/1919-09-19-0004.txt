Leader.

South Essex Liberals met in conven-
tion at Kingsville Tuesday for the pur-
pose of nominating & candidate for
the coming Provineial election, and It
proved to be an enthusiastic gather-
ing. At the morning meeting officers
were elected with N. B, Buckland, Cot-
tam, President; Mrs. W. W. Link, of
Leamington. 1st Vice president; Chas,
Clark, of Harrow, 2nd Vice-President;
F. Forster, -of Kingsville,
and W. H. Neville, Cottam, Treasurer.

About 300 were present at the after-
ncon meeting, eagh of the munleipali-
ties In the riding heing well repre-
gented..” President Buckland presided,
and on--the platform with. "H. H.
Dewart, lender of the I.Iberal party in
the Province, were gevernl Liberals
from the riding. Nominations were
called, for.» P. Upcoit and Charles
Clark nominated L. P. Wigle, the sits
ting member, and Charles Knight and
Mr. Ross nominated W. B. Clifford, of
Ruthven.

Mr. Wigle, the first speaker, ex:
pressed his appreciation of the support
given ‘him in his election five years
ago, The present Government has
governed by orders-in-cour cil’ and
commissions, but if the Libefals were
elected they would govern by the peo-
ple for the people. He WAS not elect-
ed to represent just the farmers,
though he was a farmer. He was op-
posed to class legislation and thought
they should make laws for all classes.
If nominated he yould run as a Lib-
ern] farmer. He thought there: were
two many isms in the past and be-
lleved farmers should have their just
share. Wa should all get our just

turned down by the Conservatives,
who later flopped over, and when they
had to do it gave the votes to women,
The Government had taken the Liberal
policies; why not«let the Liberals
carry ont their own policies, He pledg-
ed his support, to the nominee of the
convention.

Mr. Clifford pledged his support to
