Canada’s Greatest Statesman

 

Premier Dominian of Canada 1896—1911.

“Sir Wilfrid Laurier died at 2,30 this afternoon.” This message flashed
Tom Ottawa Monday threw.the whole Dominion fnto mourning and lowered
to half mast the flags on every public building from coast to coast, . To the
public it came like a bolt from a blue sky, as only in the larger centers was
it .known that the Veteran Chieftain, whose long public life shed such lustre
upon the country he loved so well, had suffered a stroke of paralysis Sunday.
On Saturday the old chieftain had a fainting spell from which, however, he
never recovered. On Sunday when dressing for church he had another and
lay down. Reluctant to admit to himself the seriousness of his eondition,
he strove to rise when the dinner gong rang. It was apparent at that moment
that the effusion of:blood flooded the brain and paralysis struck him. He lost
consciousness .and 4t was realized that his case was cpitical: However, he
recovered again, and toward midnight Was again conscious and had apparently
improved. A second stroke and a more serious one, came about twelve and
hope of his recovery was then sbandoned. Occasional flashes of conscious-
ness marked his condition thereafter fn the course of which he conversed
fitfully with those apound. Towards the end he sank into unconsciousness
and death came peacefully.

The body of the. beloved ex-Premier will lie inistate in the Housowof
Commnions until Saturday morning when the casket will be taken to Sacred
Heart: ¢hurch, Ottawa, where mass will be sald by Archbishop Mathicu, of
Regina, an intimate friend of the late late Opposition leader. Throughout the
country respect will be paid to his memory by places of business” closing
during’ the hour of his funeral. :

The Right Honorable Sir Wilfrid Laurjer was born at St.-Lin, Quebec,
on November 20th, 1841. graduated from McGill in*1864, entering the practice
of Jaw; began his political career 4m 1871, when he entered the Provincial
Legislature as member for Drummond and Arthabaska, for which constituensy
he set until 1874, when he was elected to the Honse of Commons for the same
constituency, He was dafested in that constituency in 1877 and since that
time he represented Quebg> Bast, Ho.avas Minister of Inland Revenue in the
MacKenzie Administration in 1877 and in 1878, and waSs.elected leader of the
Opposition In succession to the late Edward Blake in 188% which position he
has held ever ginde being returned tg office, and on the defeat of th Tupper
Government in 1896, becoming Premier and. President of the Coutlell in his
own Administratign. This office he had from July Sth, 1896, to October, 1911,
when his Governnieént suffered. defeat at the polls with the proposed reci-
procity treaty with the United States as tlie paramount#ssue. In his younger
Gays Sir Wilfrid seryed in the volunteer militia, being an ensign in the
Arthubaskaville infantry company from 1869 to 1878, during the last Feninn
Rald, for which he wore n’medal. The notable achievements of the Laurier
regime were the granting of the preferential tariff for British products, grant~
ing an autgnomy to the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Albérta;. participa-
tion of Canada with British forces in the South African war, and inauguration
of the G: T. P. Transcontinental Railway scheme. The defeat of Sir Wilfrid
Laugjers party on the conscription issue dn 1917 {8 still fresh in the public
mind. Bad

The daily papers of al! shades of politics vie with one another in paying
tribute to Canada’s premier statesman. He occupied a place so large in the
country that 18 15° almost impossible to conceive that Canada can get-along
without him, HIS logs overwhelms the Liberal panty, who loved him and pay
‘ribute to his career ag the most remarkable of the century. His life was so
conspicuous that it shines with a glow that cam never be effaced. His first
cabinet of Provincial Promiers in 1896 was the greatest combination’ of in-
tellect and political force in any cabinet since Confederation, and under, their
influence Canada awakened. from the lethargy that bound it and became a
nation. His Prefnjership will always be referred to as the “Golden Period”
in the history of Canada. Laurier pled all ‘his life for peace and toleration and
aven his politica) opponents’declare that through dll the storms of ppssion
and prejudice, he was the one outstanding consistent public man in Canada
vho retained hig composure and remained loyal to his convictions, and his-
tory will sha¥ that his course averted a racial conflict at a time when the
fate of Great Britafn and Canada was hanging in the balance. Every one
ylelds respect to.Sir Wilirid Laurier for his unfailing devotion to the unity

of the Canadian people. :
