allowed a share of both material and
labor so lately employed in the work
of producing fighting material, in @e-
cordance with the Importande of
their industry to the#quick develop-
ment of agriculiural expansion, we
may look for a rapid increase inithe
output of farm machinery and espe-
clally traetors within the next few
months,

Rumors to-"the effect that farm
machines, and especjally tractors,
were due to become clieap by. reason
oflincreased competition and exces-
sive - production existed during the
first year of the war, when farm
tractors began to be considered ser-
lously by a rapidiy~increasing nuni-
ber of farmers; but such a conditinn
cannot be looked for until gome tine
fo come or at least until ynore than
one crop has been taken off, ani
then only if the crops prove good
enough to allow‘df ‘a reduction of
prices Jord foodstuffs, so allowing® a
reduction in the cost of manufae-

withholds from encouraging industry
in which many. men incapable of

the means to do so, Is merely helding
back general production and piling
up discomfort for everybody in the
