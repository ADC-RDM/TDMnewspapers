George Bede left on Wednesday for
Birch Hills, Sask.,, where he will make
his future home. There Mr, Eede will
take charge of a 2400-acre farm, which
will glve him scope to develop the
agricultural knowledge he used to
such good effect in a smaller sphere

\Dr. J. W. Eede is located at Prince
Albert, a large town in the vicinity of

In addition to what appears else-
where in -this issue concerning the
death of Ezra Iler, It should be noted

Iler went to. Sandwich to become

The “Banana Belt” never loses Its
box of surprises. Out of this. the
tpast week Mrs. Andrew Elllott got a
new one—a full blossomed cherry
twig—which is about the pleasantest
surprise one - could have in early
March. “During the warm spell in
January, Mrs. Elliott observed their
cherry trees budding and breaking off
a small limb placed it in water in the |
house, and was rewarded with the
blossoms, which seem additionally
sweet because of thelr appearance in
winter time. A similar experiment
with a lac. branch did not turn-out
80 well. §

For some. time the P. M. station at
Marshfield hag been run down at the
heels and become a cause of reproach
to the Company. At a recent meeting

the attention of the Pere Marquette
officials-oithe complaint and demand

éplved a courteous rdply, thanking him

Just Stop to Think !

How much good. grain am I feeding my horses?

I want my horses in good condition for-the spring.
: Let matell you that strong feeding from now ‘til spring may just over-
lond their systems, and they may look well but just-break down with the
first heavy work.
: Now. it {8 no experiment to use a good renovating tonic, HESS’ STOCK
TONIC has been is use-by many farmers for 30 years, It causes’ the animal
{o digest and assimilate more out of the grain so that you can feed less grain
and have your animals In still better condition, and at the same time the
horse can do more work. ,This soon saves twice the price of the Tonic.
