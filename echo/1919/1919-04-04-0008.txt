BEFORE OR AFTER
INFLUENZA

By De. M. Cook

The cool fighter always wins and so
there is no need to become panics

   

 

stricken. Avoid fear and crowds. Ex-
: ercise in the fresh air-and practise the
bs three C's: a Clean Mouth, a Clean Skin
y and Clean Bowels. To carry off the

poisons that accumulate within the body
and to ward off an attack of the influ-
enza bacillus, take a good liver regulator
to move the bowels, such as Castor Oil
or a pill made up of May-apple, leaves
of aloe and root of jalap, to be had at
any drug store, and called Dr. Pierce's
Pleasant Pellets.
The system should be built up by the
use of a good iron tonic, such as “Iron-
5 tic” tablets, to be obtained at some drug
3 stores, or that well known blood-maker
and herbal tonic made from roots and
barks of forest trees—sold everywhere
3 as Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis-
covery.
5 For a tonic that will freshen up the
b blood, clean the digestive tract and put
- new force and vim into you, I know of
nothing better than Dr. Pierce's Goldén
Medical Discovery—and it contains no
alcohol or narcotic so is perfectly safe

 

: to take.
Wixpsor, OsT.—"Dr. Plerce’s Golden
Medical Discovery and his ‘Pleasant

Pellets' are wondertal medicines {or home
use. [ used to suffer with weak lungs,
smothering spells and sick-headaches, but
since I have taken the above mentionsd
medicines these conditions bave left me.

«Such medicines as Dr. Plerce's are
worthy of praise and I am very glad to
add my testimonial to the thousands of
others. "—Alrs, ELpeNy Hanpive, 11 Erle
