I began to improve immediately

Provincial Plans Safe
| —

In view of the pre-election declara-
‘tions anent the Provincial highway
policy, the new Government has al
ready been glving some thought to
the subject, although no decisions
have been reached. Hon. F. C. Biggs,
Minister of Public’ Works, said that
rural dwellers should have as much
comfort as urban dwellers and it is
quite evident that he desires to see
good roads in the Province.

It is unlikely that the Farmer-Labor
Coalition Government will abolish the
present Provincial Highway scheme,
That it may make minor changes
seems probable. There are now thrag
systems of highways—the Provincial
highway, toward which the Govern-
ment pays 70 per cent. of the cost;
the Provincial county highway, toward
which the Government pays 60 per
cent Of the cost, and the county high-
ways, toward which the Government
pays only 40 per cent. of the cost.

Matter of Routes.

The Provincial Highway between

Montreal, Ottawa, and Windsor is one |
of the largest undertakings in road |

development which the former Gov-
ernment will discontinue the Provin-
route has been designated, with the
exception of the portion between Lon-
don and Windsor. There are two
routes through that section which
might be used, und there has been
coRsiderable controversy. sometimes

bitter. as to which should be chosen. |

Deputation after deputation waited
on the old Government in reference
to the matter, and it is unlikely the
new Government will be allawed to
make its decision without the advo-
cates of each route putting their argu-
ments before the Ministers. 7

It iz most improbable that the Gov-
ernment wiss discontinue the Provin-
clal highway, it will not be surprising
if it decides to go ahead and make
the highway a macadam gravel thor-
oughfare. When that it done it could
go ahead as the money was available

each year, and put down a concrete?

highway for short distances on either
side or the urban centres through
which the road -passes. Thus far no
concrete work has been done on this

SAFETY FIRST FOR THE

Motorists,

 

Gas Is a deadly enemy, as almost
any returned soldier can tell you
who has -been up in the firing line.
Yet motorists in Ontario, and even in
Essex county, don't realize the grav-
ity of that statement. This Is with
reference to the gas which Is emitted
from the exhaust pipe of the automo-
lle.
