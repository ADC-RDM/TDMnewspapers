PREVENT POTATO OT

Spraying With Bordeaux Mixture
~ Proven Very Effective.

Machinery Must Be Kept Well Offed
If It Is to Work EfMciently—
An Expert Discusses the Question

From Every Angle,
LJ

(Contributed by Onturio Department of
Agriculture, Toronto.)

ATE Blight and Rot of Pota~
toes can bp prevented by
spraying with Bordeaux mix-
ture. Commence spraying
when the plants are from @Ove to
eight inches high and keep the fol-
{age covered with Bordeaux through-
out the season. Take special care to
see that the spraying is very thor-

oughly done If the weather is at all
damp about the 15th of July, as
Blight often begins about this time,
Add a polson when necessary for po-
tato beetles—arsenate of lend paste
3% Ibs. to each 40 gals. of the li-
quid spray, or Paris green 2 lbs. to
40 gals., or a mixture of 2 Ibs, arsen-
ate of lead paste and 1 1b, of Paris
green to 40 gals. From three to
seven applications should be made,
depending upon the season—the wet-
ter the weather the larger the num-=
ber. Do not put off spraying because
it looks like rain. If the spray is on
{he plants half an hour before the
rain comes it will be dry and suff
clent of it will stick to prevent im-
tection, which takes place during or
soon after rain, Such spraying
should prevent not only Late Blight
and Rot but also Barly Blight and
potato beetles.

Tharough spraying only is effective,
If thorough spraying is to be done
sufficient Bordeaux mixture must oe
used. From 650 to 150 gals per acre
should be applied at each spraying,
and when the plants are large bot
less than 100 gallons per acre should
be used. Thorough spraying means
the covering of every portion of the
potato plant with Bordeaux mixture
in the form of a fine mist. This can
only. be done when the solution i8
applied with good pressure, so as to
insure covering every portion of the
plant... The best results from spray-
ing are obtained when potato spray-
ers are used which are fitted with a
P-joint attachment so as to insure
covering both surfaces of the leaves
at each spraying. ‘When the plants
are large it has been found that it
pays to.go over each/row twice at
each spraying.—Prof. J. E. Howitt,

persistently enough. To ‘resist the
tendency of ‘the metal to tear the

The Crowning Virtue

EES rENceD motorists determine a
car's value by the service it renders.
To them, this is the paramount virtue.

This is one of the qualities that constitute
the crowning recommendation of the

Gray-Dort car.
You want speed in the stretches, power for
hills and poor roads, flexibility and easy
pick-up for city driving—the Gray-Dort
motor gives all these abundantly.

Comfort, of course—over any road. A
roomy body, deep upholstery, long springs,
insure it. Im every phase of motor service %%}
that men value you'll find the Gray-Dort
excels. And this service you get year after
year—service far surpassing the price you
pay. ;

The touring car is $1246; the Gray-Dort
Special--the car with added refinements |,
and extra equipment, is $135 extra; there

are also a coupe, and a sedan. All prices
