THE RISE OF BOHEMIA

NATION WAS RULED RY RE-
ACTIONARY AUSTRIA.

Tzech Love of Freedom Was Appar.
ent for Muny Years Before Great
War, But It Expanded and Burst
the Bonds When Teuton Alliance
Went to Pleces Last Year and
“Ramshackle Empire” Collapsed.

EFORE the war, the actual
ruling powers of Austro-Hun-
gary were in a decided minor- |
ity. But though the Slavs were |
superior in numbers, they exercised
no rule but suffered undervarious dis-
abilittes, political, social and olher-
wise. Apparently, however, they had
only to combine their forces and to
make common cause against the Ger-
man and the Hungarian, in order to
win a measure of political freedom
and their rightful standing among
the nations of Europe, For the
Bohemians and the Serbo-Croats,
this step seemed to be a natural one, |

as both could lay claim to distinctive
nationality and to historic rights, as
well as to a degree of political organ-

ization and the tradition of a-per-
sistent policy of resistance to Teu-
tonic aggression.

But there were several well-defined
reasons why any attempt to assert
Slavic historle rights might not have
been attended with success. In the
first place, the Slavs within the em-
pire could not make common cause,
for the simple reason that many of
them were merely scattered frag-
ments of races, or formed detached
portions of ancient kingdoms which
had been conquered or annexed by
an allen people. For centuries, the
Hapsburgs had maintained their
power by a subtle and well-recog-
nized policy of division. All the time,
the Slave were being permeated and
infiltrated with German thought, lan-
guage and polley, from which there
was no effective escape. Bohemia,
the most powerful of the Slay coun-
tries, was no exception to the rufe,

The Germanization to which Bo-
Remin was long subjected was such
that the preservation of her nation-
ality and her strongly marked racial
characteristics is nothing less than
remarkable under the circumstances.

She was made an integral part of the
Holy Roman Empire; indeed Prague
was at one time the capital of that
empire of the German emperors; and
German influences, German language
and literature, and German institu-
tions threatened completely to. ab-
sorb the Tzechs. But thewallenanas-
ter was never able wholly to assimi-
late the race, and the / struggle
against Teutonlzation had the one
supreme effect that it proved for the
Bohemians 4 perpetual fmpulse to-
ward a renascence of Bohemian
natural Jife and literature. It is well
it was 80; There came a time when
the Germanization of Bohemia had
reached such a stage that the Bo-
hemian language fell practically into
desuetude.

The literary revival marked by the
work of John Huss purified Bohem-
jan from Latinisms, and asserted the
language as a living entity. ‘Jt was
placed at once on a new footing as a
cultivated tongue, and in the early
part of the nineteenth century, when
the. troubling -of ~ the political
waters throughout Europe sent eur-
rents - of feeling to Bohemia, the
Tzechs set about in’ earnest. firmly
to establish their language and liter-
ature in the schools aad universities.
It is- said, however, that one of a
number of Tzech patriots and sav-
ants who met together at the time,
int a coffee house in Prague, excliim-
ed* “If thfs roof were.to fall in,
Tzech litérature would perish with
us,” To such a pass Had the Bo-
hemian cause fallen! J

When the war broke otif, it hap-
ply “found the Tzech language en-
joying equal rights with Gefman in
the sthools, In Prague, so much had
ihe language progressed that one
could hardly get an answer to a ques-
tion in Germam., German influence
has been, in fact, @ declining factor
in. Bohemian development ever since
the federation of the Germanic
states excluded the territories of the
House of Hapsburg., The Tzechs form
70 per cent. of the populition .of
their country, and an, enthusiesm for
Tzech ideals has long been aroused
among the educated and upper
classes, as well as among the people
generally.

Hence the resistance of the Tzechs
to the tyranny of Austrian’ rule
seemed to grow more pronounced in
proportion as their dearly won privi-
leges increased. * Nothing seemed to
rouse this resistance in the Tzech
more surely than the language ques-
tion. It was something the signifi-
cance ‘of which the lowliest peasant
could: underStand, and something

which came home to him personally
and vitally the moment he entered
the imperial. army as a conscript.
The rule that there should be onfy
one language in the army, and that
German, struck him at ‘once as an
assault upon his rights. Herein lay
the common source of friction be-
tween the German and the Tzech ele-
ments. The Tzech soldier had only
to refuse to answer his superiors in
German to probably cause one of
those racial outbreaks pecullar to
Prague. Punishment inevitably fol-
lowed for the offenders, with the re-
sult that the rest of the regiment
would probably .start a sympathetic

revolt, %
The revolt would often spread to

the civilian population, who readily
made common cause with the Tzech
goldiers. There would be demonstra-
tions in the theatres, and in the
cafes collisions were liable to occur
between the Jews or the German sec
tions of the population on (he one
hand and the Tzechs on tFe other,

‘Its eastern boundary. Helse the war

its existence was hardly guessed by
the man In the street; jadeed it did
not figure upon the ordinary school
map of the Austro-Hungirian empire.
Its people, though distijct now, are
probably remnants of the old Tzéch
family detached from the once Great
er Moravia {n those days when it ex-
tended as far south as {he Adriatic.
As a dominant power, Moravia came
to an end when (twas conquered by
Hungary.

But Siovakia has suddenly come
into the limelight by the prompt
action "of Tzech (troops in taking
possession of territories hitherto
held io be part of the Hungarian
crown, and by the quigk retaliation
on the part of the Hungarians, who
have attempted to eject the Tzechs
on the ground that the Allfes have |
agreed not to interfere in the internal |
affairs oftHungary. But, according to |
the Tzech, the people of the terri-
tories of the new Slovakia, which are
understood to tnclude Presaburg, the
anclent Hungarian crowning capital,
and the line of the Dinube to the
point where it bends'suddenly south-
ward toward Budapest, speak the
Tzecho-Slovak tongue; whilst on the
southern boundary and part of the
northern or Carpathian border, the
people comprise Slovaks, Ruthenians
and Magyars, This northern bound-
ary. follows the line of the Carpath-
jang through the famons High Tatra
region and extends eastward almost
halt way across Hungary. Moravia,
at the same time Is believed to lay
claim to the greater part of Austrian
Silesin, whieh separated it {rom
Prussian Silesia, Thus the once no-|
torious strip of land or gallery which
led to Galician Poland, and formed
the only outlet of Bohemia for her
goods into Russia and Polamd, has
beén, widened into a broad stretch
ot territory from which Humgary,
Austrian and Germany are conupletely
shut out,

Should these newly defined bound-
aries, which have already brought the
young” Bohemian republic into dis-
favor with Hungary, be wpheld at
the Peaee Conference, fhe long
threatened ‘action of the:Cemtral em-
pires in shutting Bohemia off econ.

would see to It that Bohemia’s mer-~
chandise reached the sea and the outs

part of Dantzig on the Baltic.—The

Had To Be Careful.

The best story the Peaos Confer-
ence has brought out is that told in
the New York Worldt When the
German = fleet surrendered to the
British the captive crews were taken
abotrd British battleships: One big
round-headed German wus plainly
disgusted’ with the way things had
gone and showed it,” Walling up to
a group of British sailors he spat
overboard and sald; “'Thait’s what I
think of your verdammt fleet, and
as for Admiral Beatty, wihy”—and
he spat aver the ral) agsim. Then
he spat a third time by way of ex-
pressing his opinion of the whole
British nation.. As he finished, a blg
British saflor hitched his pants up
and ‘sald: “Look here, Frfitz! = You
can say what you please about the
British fleet—and as much as you
wish toward Admiral Bemtty — and
think what you want about the Brit-
ish. But you be damn well careful

whose ocean you go spitting into!”

Leap Year.

Leap year Is a, year which leaps
over, as it were, one day more than
an ordinary year; a year which con-
tains 366 days, as distingmished from
an ordinary year, which includes
only 365 days, Every year the num-
ber of which is divisible by four is a
leap year, except when it happens
to be any number of hindreds not
divisible by four. Thus 1884 was a
leap year, put not 1900, this omis-
glon of leap years in such cemturies
befng necessary to- correct the error
which arises from the excess of the
addition of one day in four years
(L e., six hours) to the year over
the type length of the year, lLe., 366
days 5 hours 49 minutes. 3
