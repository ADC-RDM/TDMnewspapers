Father to the

(Copyright, 1918, by McClure Newspape!

“Bosh,‘you dear little goose!”

And then, having mildly rebuked
her, Carter Danbury leaned over and
tried to gather the dainty little crea-
ture at his side Into his arms. ‘But

she wriggled away and faced him with
a determined look in her big brown
eyes,

“I'm not a little goose,” she retort-
“And father Is right.
You're a ‘Ran and politics 18 a man's
game, a p0n's duty. You ought to
pitch [p—3ou‘re a Republican.”

“On eledion day,” he admitted, “but

“That's {¢.| 8he took him up quickly.
“You're arrid. Carter—please—for my
sake. I've ©!d Lim you're sensible, a
fine man.”

Danbury “owned.

“But,” ne argued, “dearest, I can't
take ordeiS. I don't llke—" He hesl-
tated, fopiiul lest he might offend this
duughter 9f Colonel Reuben Thomus,
the big” boss. “I don’t like being
bogsed, 1 don't like the petty artifices
these—poliiiclans resort to to get
votes,”

“But [t's necessary,” she argued
back, “phere must be leaders.”

Danbury smiled. When Dorothy
Thomas 100ked like that she reflected
every fedlure of her father's intlexible
face, escept his wrinkles. Danbury
sought Lo soothe her, but to no avail.

“Plexse, Carter,” she persisted, “If
you love me, try it. You—might like
ft

“All right,” he gave In, and again
leaned over towards her, this time to
meet a delicious kiss full upon his lips.
“But mind pow, all I'm to do Is to offer
my services: I'll not.be to blame |
they refuse them and—I hope tly y
will” 4

A Ieen-eyed youngish old-man faced
Carter Danbury the following morn-
ing ncross his flat-topped desk and
stroked his bristling white goatee, as
he listened to the other attentively.
They were closeted alone in’ the Inner
sanctum of the campaign headquarters
of “Willian Westlake, the People's
Cholce for United States Senator.”
Then the ‘oracle’ spoke,

“So my dnughter persuaded you,
eh?" queried the Republican leader,
severely, “‘See here,’ young man, you

 

can't take wp this business as a fad. | A
| | the son agatn is Tather to the man. I

Once Ig lowe, you have to stick.” !
Something In the colonel's tone |
stung Danibury to the quick and he |

“I'm not m faddist, Colonel Thomas,”
he retorted hotly. “I've just held aloof

wanted to keep my independence, my |
ideals. Butt I'll stick.” |
“Huh!” grunted the other. “I sup-
pose you realize I'm the party's
leader?”
“Yes,” wms Carter's smiling ,re-
Joinder.” “Thhe papersshave told me
that much,” ’ :
“Well, they haven't told you all,”
shot back “fthe colgnel. “I expect to
have my orders obeyed.” The colbnel
pushed a bmtton and another man en-
tered the aflce. - “Burke, this 1s Mr
Danbury. How are. you fixed for
speakers tonight at East End hall 7’
“Only yourself and Westlake so far,”

answeresi-the-ather; respestfully.

, “Them put him on; too,” ordered the
Colonel, crisply. Then as the other re-
tired from the raom, he turned again

to Danbujry. “Be there at eight, "And | “Whispered, laying his hands affection-

mind, don't get rambuncueus, young
feller. Use diplomacy. There'll be a
lot of foreigners there, and we want
to handle them gently. G'by.”

Carter Danbury was facing his first
political audience, und yet he felt
cooler thay he had expected. He had
followed the candidate, Westlake, who
now sat behind him, on the stage, with
Colonel Thomas, wiping his perspiring
brow and ymirking grandiloquently at
the sea of upturned faces. And much
to Carter's surprise, as he proceeded,
he was frequently applauded. This
added to his courage and he now lean-
ed over t§ deliver his final philippic.

“And, fellow Americans,” he orated,

“thls Is a4 American age. There can

be no divided allegiance. We have
come to the day when there shall be
an Americay royce, an, American nation
—for Améyicans only. We shall pre-
Berve our gh deals sacredly, and te

Institfitions and then spread it abread.

prise, ust Ay

“You heedn't pull my coat,” he thun-

he said? What had he done? Then,
later, ns he left the hall, his cheerful
farewell to Colonel Thomas WAS an-
swered by a surly grunt, hd

The next morning he was still at sen
when Dorothy informed him thot her
father had refused him admission to
the house.

He hurried to campaign hendquar-
ters and was told Colonel Thomas
couldn't see him—the committee was
In session. “Where was he assigned
to speak that night?" he inquired, and
was surprised to learn he was on the
bincklist. “Why?” he demandeds=he
clerk couldn't tell h!m. Then Danbury
heatedly forced his way Into the com-
mittee room, and with blazing eyes
confronted Colonel Thomas.

"Colonel Thomus,"” he began, “what
Is the trouble around here? What have
I done?”

“What have’ yom done?’ echoed
Westlake at the other end of the room.
“Too blame much, You've ruined me.
After that fool speech of yours I'll be
lucky to get ten votes in the Fourth
district. We're spending a. thousand
dollars today to deny your states
ments." :

“To deny your Americanism?’ de-
manded Carter. and he now turned
wrathfully towards the candidate,
“Why not call a spade a spede? See
here, you call yourself statesmen, I
call you traitors, You're afraid to ne-
knowledge the country who gave you
birth, who gives you a living, to back
It up to the full, just because it might
lose you votes. You're yellow—yel-
lower than those poor people whose
votes you're after, They're Americans
—every one of them, And they're glad
of It." They, or thélr forbears came to
this country torseek liberty, to seck the
right to live «( enjoy our freedom.
And pow «they're proud of it—they,
who have heen here months—while
you, who have enje 1 those rights all
your lives, d you rople befare you,
haven't cou enough to protect the
country that protects you. Who's the
“warse—they with thelr hopes, their
Ideals, or you who turn your backs
upon the hopes and ideals your fore-
fathers fought for and left to your
Keeping? “Wiliere's your Americanism
—the Americanism of cournge, of de-
cency, of truth? And now, Colonel
Thomas, you didn't want me to enter
this-cnmpalgn—afraid I wouldn't stick.
Jut I'm just beginning to see my duty
—1 want to stick—I demand the right
to stick. And I call upon the members
of this commitfee to sustain me with
their votes. Do I get them—or not?"

At the end of the table a tall, white-
haired old man, who stroked his brist-
ling white gontee, roke and rapped for
order. Then he bent his full gaze on
Danbury.

“You do,” he answered, sharply, and
then the corners of his mouth quis
ered, “Gentlemen of tlie committee,

night, and I rise with shame to uc-

prefer the former,” He turned to Dan-

father's father gave him his swo'd.
‘Keep this, my ‘son,’ says he, ‘an’
nevah use “It except fonh two pur-
poses, eithnh t' kill sorhe beastly ene-
my, or t' kill yoselfsfonh not doin’ It.
An' If T had that swo'd now, suh, I'd

He turned again. fo the committee,
“Gentlemen, I move th’ committee ex-
tend a risin’ vote of invitation te ouah

bury—Amerienn, t° speak at th’ big
meetin’ at th' Aendemy tonight. What's

As the members of the committee
rose to thelr feet, en masse, the colonel
turned his Dack gn them and motioned
to. Bunbury to eome to him.

. “You've scen th’ vote, Carter,”she

ately on the young man's shoulder.
“And you know what it means. But,”
and his voice sunk lower still, “come

How to Test Colors.

If the color Is solid or with lttle
white plait a sample of it with a strip
of white material. Make a strong soap
solution. Have it warm but not hot.
Rub and squeeze the goods in this, for
ten minutes. Rinse In cold water, let
it dry. If the color holds fast, the
water not colored and the strip of
white not stained one muy be pretty
sure of the color. To test for light,
expose a piece of material, in both a
wet and dry condition, to strong sun-
light for a week. If the goods do not
show signs of fading It Is reasonably
sure. they will not do so. If you want
various colors for a cotton rug at
small.expense use Easter egg dyes.
