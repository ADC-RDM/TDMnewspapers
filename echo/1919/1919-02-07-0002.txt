There were many more questions In
tho same veh, and Alison finswered
them prompfly, assuring the Kindly
vice president that she smoked not at
all nnd absmined from games of
chance, She ate egg salad and milk
for luncheon, went tp bed early and
spent her evenings “at home.” She
didn’t add that these evenings were
qometimes spent with her tired little
body resting on the soft upholstery of
the long chair In her own ttle bed-
room reading some one of her favorite
Spanish or Italian authors that she
had learned to admire in college.

The next letter expressed approval
of the young boy's steady habits, but
he reproved the boy for not going to
night school, and ended by telling him
tht he would give a prize of $50—
thant he always offered MESSCNEETS in
the concern, but had never been won—

ly to the study of Spanish that within
sx months he could command a alight

Ho himself, he gaid, had been handi-

mastered a'foreign langunge. It was
anly recently, when his time for such
study was limited, that-he had taken
up Spanish. It was the great langunge

The office manager in the New. York
‘office when he heard of the step she
hnd taken, predicted a stormy recep:
tion for Allson. Fe felt that he knew
juste how Thorne wi uld snub her. But
the stopm and the snub were not forth-
coming. Thorne told her that at first
he had not known, thél he chancedito
so the Néw Yopk piper that had the
Oflice manager's advertisement for gin
messengers, and, beside, he suspected
from the ege-saind- luncheon and the
hand writing that she was a girl. But
It mide no difference, he fissured her.
He was a thorough-going feminist, if
that’ meant entire spproval of giving
glrlg an equul chance With boys when
they proved themselves capable of
grasping It. Ang this girl hand proved
herself more promising than nny of
the messenger boys that had ever
drifted Into the employ of "the con.

Then one day Thorne called: Allsan.
