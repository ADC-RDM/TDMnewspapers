REPORT OF THE SURBURBAN AREA ROAD COMMISSONERS.

Jo the Warden and Members of Hasex County Council: —

Gentlemen, —During the past yer wo have not done any permanent road
pullding excont dg the w

of concrete culverts and a steel brid
geover Little
River on Road No. 8. And attached hereto you will find an {temizedstatement
of construction and maintenance.

As many of the suburban roads are worn out, wa would eat that
permanent construction be started this year, and would To you
appropriate as much as you can for permanent improvement within the
auburban area. Our {den would be to continue a concrete road fom Pilette
Corners in Sandwich East as far aa possible, and we think that a gart should
also be made on the Huron Line in Sandwich West. While we must admit
that the road known as the Gravel Road is possibly the main road and needs

new conptruction, Wo are In hopes that the Government will assune It as a
Provincial Highway, and thus relieve us.

In conclusion we wish to make mention of the position of the City of
windsor withithe County in reference to the payment for the maintenance
and construction of the roads jn the Suburban Area. We are tld by the
Clerk that he, as required, rendered to the City a bill for the wack done in
1916 and 1917, also a statement of the estimated amount required for 1918.
aut the Treasurer tells up that up to date the City of Windsor had not pald
anything. We would therefore suggest and recommend that the County
council take such steps as are necessary to collect from the City of Windsor

the amounts dus by the City to tie County for the maintenance and construc-
tion on the roads within the Suburban Area.
