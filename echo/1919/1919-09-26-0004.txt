dently the Invitations were not re-
stricted tora small territory as tiey
were gathéred from far and near.
For nearly three hours the young folks
enthusiastically participated in ver
tous lawn games, and when bugle was
sounded for lunch all felt eqial to tha
task. Just before tHe departure, Rav.
A. Spracklin and Percy P. McCallum
spoke for a few moments expressing
a regret of losing Herschell for ‘a
short time, who has been aa active
worker {n ycung people's circles and
sports and who is one of Malden's
most popular young men, but there
was a tone of pride nmong his host of
friends in the fact that he had decided
to better fit himself to fulfill his placg
in life, Herschell made a short an
suitable reply, thanking his friends.
He left on Thursday last for Guelph.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:

At the solicitation of a great number of my friends,
1 have concluded :to offer miyself as an . Independent
‘Candidate for the.coming election of members for -the
Legislative Assembly of Ontario... I have had a lot of
experience with party politics, and have firmly made up
my mind that the time has come when measures come
before Parliament the people's representatives should
judge them miore from a business, thaw a party stand-
point. : TH ae?

1 would like to represent this Riding once more land
show the Electors the difference between being perfectly
independent, and being bound by party ties. If elected
as an Independent, I would feel that the: responsibility’
had fallen upon me to, use my influence for the hest
interest ,of all good organizations in the Province, If
the Hearst Government is sustained, I wil support it in
all of what I consider are good measures. If the Liberal |
party is returned to power -and its leader, Mr. Hartley

Dewart, K.C., is called“uipon to form a government, I will
support him and his party in the same way, but will re-

serve’ the right to oppose either party if. they bring 1

measures which I believe are against the best interests:
of the country.

whichever party is returned to power, promises to carry.

I would be particularly pleased to champion the ins
