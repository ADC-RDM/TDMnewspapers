GOOD ROADS DEP UTATION.

feofet

A gathering of Pasties men of Am.
herstburg, with representatives from
Malden and Anderdon, met In the old
telephone building Wednesday night
and discussed good roads with County
Treasurer Millen and County Roads
Superintendent Knister, more particu-
larly with reference to the Improve-
mont of the River Front road, and the
enlarging of the county roads pen
to embrace; all the municipalities
the County. It was the ei
opinfon of all pfesent that the River
Front road from Turkey Creek to Am-
herstburg should In all fairness be tak-
en in as an integral part of the county
system, eligible for both Government
and county assistance as it Is one of
the most Important highways in the
county over which the traffic is for
the most part foreign to the district;
and besides improvement of the front
road would be offering an inducement
10 manufacturers to locate along the
front and build up the southern paft
of the county, the same as along Ford
| and Walkerville; the result ‘of thisf
would_be to reduce the whole county
taxation: by “reason of the {increased
asaessment: of the county due to the
location or these manufacturing (n-
dustries here, After an hour's discus:
sino, the meeting unanimously. sup-
ported the following respfution:

Moved by Mr. Papat, seconded by
Mr. Patton, that this deputation ap-
prove of a whole county road scheme,
supporting an gmended plan. to desig-
nate the River Front road, from Tur-
key Creek; through Amlirestburg, Har-
row, and to Kingsville as a Provin-
clal County Highway; failing that.
ngk the county for a specific grant of
20 per cent. to ald In building the
