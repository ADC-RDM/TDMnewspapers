wag spent on doctors’ bills, with.

Zawm-Bulk, which effected a complete
cure!” gays Mrs. Fred Gervals of
126 Bleury St, Montreal,

“A rash broke out on my baly's
skin, and she became very fretful
and lost welght. 1 took her to a
doctor, who gave me some lotion to
apply, but it did not do baby any
good. 1 then took her to another
doctor, but with the game result.

“Then a friend, who saw the con-
dition baby was in, brought me
some Zam-Buk, which she so highly
recommended that 1 commenced
using it. In one week's time baby
looked much better, and before a
month had elapsed she was quite
well again,

“baby is now the plcture of
health, and I think it wonderful
that §2.worth of Zara-Buk brought
about th!s ciiré when $30 spent in
doctors’ treatments did no good
whatover! I certainly advise other
mothers not to experiment with use- -
less remedfes, but to save thelr”
little ones unnecessary” suffer;
and themselves nendless anxiety ahd
expense by using Zam-Buk in the
first place.”

Zam-Buk 1s also best for eczema,
