Gorge Skinner had tried his band
at wrious undertakings. His Inck of
stickat-1t-ive-ness bore, as result, that
nervus, unsatisfied eye.

Gorge had tried a little of every-
thing He had grown courageous once
or tvice and had attempted work, but
soon reformed and went back to his
former ways, He even tried matri-
mony.

He wns willing t» try anything ex-
cept year In and yes: out industry. To
do him. justice, It might be said that
he stuck, closer to tie general run of
affairs. surrounding Dorse-racing than
anything else, but KS Investments at
the track were not always made with
his own eilsh.

"| After some wear and tear of gray

matter, he came to the conclusion that
a man of thirty who has a wife should
be Insured; mot for any Small figure,
but for something substantial ; as high
as he could stand for premiums.

Then he spoke to his wife,

Why, yes, of course, a wife should
be protected. Not that she wished
him to be so soon thereafter robed In
white and starting In the feather-wing
business. Oh, no, not at all.

Instead, how much better if he could
only dle—just officially die—and then
come back and enjoy that which they
need not work for. Lovely!

And now his mind was too busy
with plans and ways; his brain was
working on full time and up to its full
capacity; working out a scheme and
dreaming of the enjoyment of that
scheme consummated. Then flight.

They could go fo—well, far away,
anywhere. George's application to the
study of geography had been indiffer-
ent, They could go somewhere and
be drowned in a new life as easily as
he intended to be—officiai—drowned
In Long Island sound.

He little thought of extradition
treaties, which are so broad that a
United States citizen can be brought
back for no greater offense than steal
ing a glance at his neighbor's wife,
or' shooting = man with a kodak.
George was occupied with three ideas:
to raise premiums; his widow (2) to
‘collect the inswmrance; flight.

Through the generous odds offered
by a bookmaker ten dollars on a lucky
horse supplied mim with a roll with
which he took out a. policy for ten
thousand. And to celebrate the start
of his get-rich-quick scheme he blew
his wife to a swell a 1a carte dinner.

And right here, If he hid used
glasses with strong lenses instead of
strong contents, he would have viewed
his finish In the foreground.

In less than six months hé had Iin-
creased his {insurance another ten
thousand, the premium being acquired
partly as bafor& buit on a horse pay-
ing lower‘odds, and the balance on an
outside matter, the detail of which
he was not disposed ‘to discuss, not
even with his wife. (Call it specula-
tion, for he dfl speculate as to his
safety In the matter.

The summer was losing and the
water would soon be two cold for com-
fortable drowning, such as he intend.
,ed: doing—to all intents and purposes.
It was time to act, byt his Insurance
was not as high as be intended. |

but It-was necessary and had to be

twenty thousand and helping in other
ways the third partner was to get one

share. So it was settled. |

{

The third partner in this game had

been more fortunate in’ some ways,

gaving. He had put his spare dollars

and epent his Idle moments In a

launch. :

So In his selection George had
picked out the right man. . This launch
wns necessary stage property in ithe
play. :

George's first move wis to go east

ll on a night bodt, and again on another.

He selected one that took a course

through the migrje of the sound.

east In the widest Dirt, some ten miles

from land on elthei hand, and bear-

from another lighthouse on the north

This was the exact spot where he
was to—ofclally=—drown; ten miles
from the nearest land. This was the
place where his ‘two partners were to
‘be with the laulich, waiting to see him

wid of n whistle fastened to his waist
ho could call them, and with the two-
candle power light from a poeket efec-

abouts, provided a boat from the
steamer did not como on the scene he-
fore the lnunch and thus upset all his

calculations,
This would truly be sad, and would

necessitate planning a new way to |

dle. But even now his drowning
might be a reality in spite of all his
careful“ preparations.

Accordingly, ‘to prove the judgment
of his third partner to steer a launch
on a course due south from thelr
lighthouse, George made two more
trips, throwing overboard at the exact
spot, timed from his own lighthouse
at the west end of the sound, a coun-
terbalanced bagavhich floated a small
electric light, and on each occasion his
partners were within a half mile of
the floating lamp, which they rescued
and returned to George ut Bridgeport
on his way back to New York by: rall.

The night for the real act arrived.
His partners left Brllgeport in thelr
launch upon receipt of a wire,

On the steamboat George identified:
himself at the office to the purser,
and also at the bar, He seemed In
the best of spirits and made an ap-
pointment to meet. the bartender on
his next trip te New York, when he®
would give him some valuable tips on

the races.
George was so friendly that he made

the acquaintance of a stranger at the

bar, with whom he talked races. They
mnde an appointment to meet In
New York. After an exchange of
drinks the twe strolled aft on the up-
per deck.

He said that just now he needed the
alr, for It was elose, so he went and
sat on the side rall. A most careless
thing for anyone ta do unless he
wishes to make n widow ofan other-
wise satisfied wife,

Te was talking a litle thick, Then
after looking at his watch once more—
a habit people have who have drunk
too much—he returned the watch to
his pocket and then—then there was a
cry and a splash, ¥ 4

The deek, save for one or two, J as
deserted, and In the romationzof [
man overboard it was minutés ‘before
the steamboat was stopped dnd more
minutes before a small boat was low-
ered, which was then n mile or more
away from the place of the accident.
After a search of no hulf mille astern
the boat returned, and the officers
used rude, impolite language to ex-
press their views upon a passenger
who will delay a boat's schedule by
falling overboard.

The strunger was much excited, as
any stranger naturally would be who
wad not been let into the details of
the drownlpg act.

For the rest, there were the usual
notices. The widow, was notified; she
promptly had bysterin and could not
be seen thereafter, except by the
stranger, who two dnys after called
and extended genulne sympathy and
relnted all he knew of the’ sad acel-
dent, He spoke of the appointment
they bad made, and he offered his
services, If needed in ipy way. They
were accepted to the extent of giving
his testimony to the Insurance com-
pany. , 2

George muintuln®d®n.femporiry res-
[dence In Bridgeport—not that Bridge-
port is a first stop between here and
the hereafter; but it was just now con-
venient. He communicated with his
widow- through the third partner.

Finally, after*a-long delay, the com-
puny agreed to settle. Then the third
partner evolyed a new idea. The
widow must become his wife. His
wife? ( Why, she was the wife of
George! ;

“George nothing. George Is dead.”

“Yes, but we know that George 8
not dead.” RE

“Prue, but the law, sfbpresented by

HE Barberry shotild not be

tolerated by the farmers of

Ontarfo. It is a thief dn

their midst, which every
year takes money from thelr pockets,
by increasing the amount of rust up-
on their grain, and thus reducing
their crops. .

The Barberry Increnses the Amotint
and Severity of Rust.

It Is not necessary to go into the
complicated life-history of the fun-
gus which causes stem rust of grain.
Scientists hnve known for many

years that one phase of its life-cycle
is passed on the Barberry, and all
who have made a study of this mat:
ter agree that the amount and sev-
erity of stem rust is very much in-
creased by the presence of the Bar-
berry in the neighborhood of grain
flelds. While scientists do not expect
to see rust entirely disappear if the
Barberry is destroyed, the general
consensus of opinion is that {f ft
were completely exterminated the
chances of severe epidemics of stem
rust occurring would be greatly
reduced.

Enforce’ the Law Regarding the
Burberry.

In Ontario legislation has . been
passed regarding the destruction of
this shrub. Let all concerned realize
that the Barberry doeh increase the
amount and severity of stem rust
and a sentiment will be created for
the enforcement of the present act.
This act should be enforced. The
Barberry in Ontario should be de-
stroyced. ‘There {8 strong evidence to
show that Barberry bushes are cen-
tres of infection which in wet aea-

The Common Barberry and Its Pur-

The Common Barberry and fits
purple-leaved variety harbor grain
rust. ~The average man does not
know this shrub when he sees it. Jt
ig a spiny shrub from six to nine feet
high, with yellow wood, arching
branches and gray twigs. The leaves
are bright green, smooth, somewhat
oval, from one to three inches long,
the margins with bristly teeth. The
flowers are small, yellow and borne
in long, drooping clustérs. The ber-
ries are oblong, red and sour. The
purple-leaved variety is similar ex-
cept for the color of the leaves, which
are ‘purple. Unfortunately, the Bar-
berry has been much planted in some
sections of ‘Ontario for ornamental
purposes and has become wild In
many localities.

The Japanese Barberry Harmless.

If Barberries are required for or-
namentgl shrubs the low growing,
small leaved Japanese Barberry
(Berberis thumbergil, D.C.) may be
planted, as this species does not har-
