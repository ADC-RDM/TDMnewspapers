After a sleepless night Peggy was
up at six. To her surprise, her mother
was stirring in the hall. Peggy opened
her door, - “What Is it, mother?” shé
asked.

“It's: Susan; she's slck! ) I've been
up all night with her, - I think she got

Peggy by this time had accepted the
Inevitable, changed to a blue linen
dress with white collar and enfts and
apron, and decided to make the best
of It.

She was out sweeping some extra
large chunks of mud off the front
steps when Captain Pearson arrived,

Peggy did pot run, nor hide the
broom. She stood smiling down at
him from the top of the steps—a blue
goddess with the emblem of woman's
sphere“in her -hand. The humor of
the” situation lent an added sparkle
to her emile;

“Pm so glad to see you, captain.”
she sald, holding out her unoccupled

REALLY BEARER OF MESSAGE

Pain Has Its Purposes and Should by
No Means Be Looked Upon
as an Enemy.

Pain is a message sent to the brain
to report that some part of the body
{s In trouble, and to ask for rellef. It
18, therefore, not an tfimixed evil, but
a bane or a blessing, according to the
view that we take of it. . Many peér-
sons; especially those whose nervous
organizations ‘are acutely sensitive,
dread ymin, both for themselves and
for others; to such a degree that thele
first. instinet Is to do something—any-
thing—If sonly the distress tan! be
checked. They refuse to listen to the
message, and think only of hushing it.
If we adopt the view that pain is a
fyithful servant bringing us a mes-
sage,” we nlten qur whole attitude to-
ward it. - We learn to listen patiently
and to organize rellef wisely, But we
must remember ‘that there is pain that
cafi and must be borne, and pain that
cannot and should not bé borne,

In certain kinds of aceldent, such as
extensive burns or lacerations, the phy-
slciin alwnys gives the speediest tem-
poracy relief that {8 in his power and
then removes the sufferer to a place
where he can give him proper care, In
such cases the call for the'morphine

effect of the drug had worn off and the

Many of the pains we suffer ars cow-

little courage would give us rellef, but
