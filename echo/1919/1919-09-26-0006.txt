HE erosion of hillsides and

an economical logs to many farmers
in hilly and mountainous sections.
This can frequently be prevented,
and the methpd employed depends on
the conditions existing, such as-the
nature of ihe soll; light or heavy,
the. steepness of the slope, and the
type of agriculture practiced; pasture
or tilled crops.

Wet hillsides used as sheep pas-
tures may be much improved by what
are sometimes called “sheep-drains.”
These are merely shallow open

nite chanzel to w suitable outlet at
the base of the hill. The removed
earth shouid pe thrown out on the
lower ‘side to form a sort of em-
bankment to the drain. The grade
of the ditch ghould not be so steep
as to give the water sufficient force
to destroy the drain by either wash-

ing away the banks or digging the
drain itself deeper and thus making
it dangerous for the sheep and lambs.
Sub-drains are sometimes necessary.

A system of terracing i8 quite
universally used to prevent destruc-
tive washouts on hillsides. The ter-
races are made perfectly level and
‘of any width and then caréfully seed-
ed to grass. At the time of rain the
water spreads out evenly over the
surface of these and then flows gont-
ly over the slope below without suffi-
cient force to wash away any portion
of the RIIl and thus poevents
“gulleying.”

For the drainage of tilled hillsides
a system of under-drainage Is some-
times used suceesslully. The amount
of. erosion of the land largely de-
pends on its condition. If the sur-
face soil can be kept firm the erosion
will be lessened. Soft spots on the
hillside, though, frequently occur as
a result of seepage water from above
which has penetrated the' surface
soil and reached an impervious layer

and thus deflected to the surface on.

the side of the hill. Water flowing
over this with considerable force will
naturally wash it away more easily
than the firmer soil free from this
seepage water.

If tile drains are so laid to inter-
cept this seepage water, considerable
erosion can Ge prevented. Ifthe hill-
pide is comparatively steep,’ drains
laid at an angle to the incline will be
more satisfactory. They will natural-
Jy intercept 'all of the water flowing
through the soil above them. Also
the grade will be less and the drains
are not so liable to.b¢ affected by the
water moving slowly through them.
If the slope {8 not very steep the
drains may be lauld down the incHne
with/gatislactory results, Here the
tile drains the land on both sides
and no double drainfng results.

In this underdrainage the general
benefits are again obtained, The
water levelofs lowered, thus glying
mare root capacity to plants and the
prevention of surface washing by
allowing the water to penetrate
through the eoil to the drains, thus
carrying much plant food to the roots
of the plants,.—R. C. Moffatt, M.A.,

Methods of Keeping Cow Records.
Four things are necessary for keep-
ing cow records: eoig¥
1. A monthly milk sheet, ruled so
that there sHall be a column for re-
cordimg the wejght gf the, morning
and evening milking of each cow for
each day of the month, though some
use asheet ruled for three days only,
and estimate the weight of milk given
for the month from these three days,
which may be consecutive, or.on the
first, tenth and twentieth of the
month, making ten-day periods be-
tween. The Ontario Department of
Agriculture, Toronto, will furnish
(free) monthly milk record sheets
to those interested. .
2, A milk scale preferably one
having a al face and two hands, one
Fof which shows the net weight of
milk in the pall, when properly set.
This scale costs about five dollars.
3. A four to eight bottle Babcock

| test, where it is desired to know what

each cow's milk tests in fat. This
will cost from cight to twelve dollars
complete. (If a member of a cow-
testing nssoclation or convenient to
a. creamery or cheese factory, ar-
rangements can usually be made to
test the samples, hence the tester Is
not needed, but a progressive dairy-
man should have his own testing out-
fit and use IL.) »

4. The fourth and most {important
requirement. 18° ““The-will-to-do.”
Without this, milk sheets, scales,
testers, cic, are valueless.” By having
scale, sheat, pencil, sample Dottles
properly labelled, ete., all convenient
ly arranged, i: takes but little time
to keep a record of each milking cow
in the herd.

We would add a4 fifth’ need, which
fs some form of ent record
book for monthly © and tests, as
milk sheets, and nl or records of
testing, are likely to ‘tw lost and not
avallable for reference, Sut if these
are recorded once & mol a per-.
manent form, they will Prive a sourced
of help in breeding, fieding and
weeding dairy cows. — Prof. H. H.
