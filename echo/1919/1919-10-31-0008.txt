THE ECHO PRINTING CO., kimited

JOHN A. AULD, A. W. MARSH,
President. Sec-Treas.

 

By 91 voles to 61, the bill authoriz-
jog the Government to proceed to the
acquisition of control of the Grand
Trunk Railway system was read a sec-
ond time in the House on Thursday
night, and the amendment of D. D.
McKenzie. calling for potponement of
consideration of the legislation until
another session, was defeated. he
division was reached at midnight pre-
cisely, and the close of the discussion
of the principle of the bill was cele-
brated by singing by Government sup-
porters before the recording of the
vote, “1 want to go home" was the re-
{rain of their song, and [t was based
upon the plea of Hon. W. L. Macken-
zien King, the new Opposition leader,
for prorogation of the session, and
discussion of the Grand Trunk pro-
posal at another after the
members had had gn opportunity of
consulting their constituents. The
vote was practically a party one.

WORKING CLASSES .
BACKBONE OF LOAN

Their $500 and Under Subscriptions
Are Required to Make New Vic-
tory Loan a Success.

 

Every, little bit counts
citizen of Canada who faith in the
futare of his. country withhold his
financial help to the new Victory Loan
enterprise because he is only able t6
afford $100.

He should take heart from the fact
that ‘the working classes formed the
backbone of the subscribers to last
year’s Victory Loan. , There were no
fewer than 707.301 ‘subscribers of
$600 and under "and thei rsubscrip-
tions amounted to over $100,000.000:

Now, if every subscriber of $500 and
under Jast vere to resolve to
double the amount of their subscrip-
tions during the present effort the
Loan would,be on the straight road to
success. The working clagses stand to
benefit considerably from the wise use
of the working capital provided by the

Victory Loan. ‘They have shared in
the prosperity which has been the
good fortune’of- Canada during the

war and after, and they will partici-
pate in the advantages of the trade
and business whith will continue dur-
ing the reconstruction period as the
effect of their financial help and co-
operation. .

Let he slogan ‘of the average man
