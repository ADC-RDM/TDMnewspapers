very Interesting and profitable results
have been obtained. At this station,
two four-year rotations are being car-

well tile-drained, the other, on land
adjoining, with good surface drainage,
only narrow lands being ploughed and
the furrows kept clear. The soll 18
similar in character on both areas.

in 1918, Banner oats were sown on
both fields. Those sown on the tile
drained land were sown much earlier
than those on the undrained land and
vielded 56 bushels per acre costing
363% ¢, per bishel.

The surface drained land could not
be worked nor smwn until several days
later and yielded 2). bushels per acre,
costing 74%c per Wshel, a difference
of 34 bushels per acre. The highest
vield is low compared tv wha: may be
expected after the dmined land is
cultivated a few times and ta: drains
have been working to the best ad-
vantage,

O fruit tree disease this year

hae been so conspicuous and

80 injurious ag the Leaf Curl

of Peaches. ' Jn early June

more than half of the peach orchards

between Beamsville and St. Cath-
arines and many orchards in other
localities were so badly affected that
almost every leal was distorted,
swcllfen and turning a brownish
color, Most of these trees will not
enter. winter nearly so healthy nor
bear 80 Jarge a crop next year us if
they had not been attacked by the
Leaf Curl. .
Control.

This year's experience, though a
hard one; will doubtless be of much
value to the fruit grower, for it has
shown as perhaps seldom before the
great imporiance of early spraying of
peaches to prevent Leaf Curl.
By early ‘we mean before the
leaf buds: have * begun to swell.
Sometimes late spraying, that
is spraying after tlie buds have begin
to swell, will control ithe disease, but it
will“ only do so where the wet
weatherfdoes not come until after the
spraying, . A single day's rain would
not of course be. sufficient to start
the disease, It ixkes several days of
moist weather, There is good evi-
dence that’ ev fall! spraying after
the leaves have dropped will - also
control it,

The best mixtunze to use is lime-
gulphur about 1 gallon to 7 gallons
of water,  Solmble sulphur 12
pounds to 49 munllons of water will
also “control the disease, but
