From what has baen sald above re-
garding the way the disease is
spread, it will at omce be seen that
one way to keep the disease from a
healthy herd is to ‘take all steps ne-
cessary to prevent. materials ¢contam-
inated by sick hogs from coming In
contact with (he hemlthy herd.

In Canada (by ordier of the Veter-
inary Director-General)—If by any
chance the disease gulins entrance to
a herd anywhere in Cunada, the laws
of the Dominion require that a veter-
inary inspector be notified without
delay. Failure to minke this notitica-
tion afeans loss off compensation for
animals slaughtered under the act,
and liability /to'a heavy fine.—Prof.
D. H. Jones, O. A. College, Guelph,

not wait.. It must be done at a defi-
nite time.” Fallufre to do It then
medns failure to get clean fruit, Ex-
perience shows there is no one factor
56 important in obtaining a good crop
as spraying. Therefore apply busi-
nesas-like forethought to it, Estimate
at once how much material you will
need and place yowr order for this
not later tham March 1st with den-
nite Instructions to have it shipped
to you by the first week in April.

If you have to purchase a new out-
fit find out the muake you think best
and’ have it shipped just as soon as
« possible. Run mo risk of its not be-
ing on hand when required.” If the
old outfit is to be used,do not fail to
overhaul and test it out in March or
early April. Dom't leave it until the
first day of sprayihg. /If you have to
send it away to be repaired remem-
ber that many others will be doing
the same and If you postpone sending
until April you will in the rush of
work have to walt your turn and may
