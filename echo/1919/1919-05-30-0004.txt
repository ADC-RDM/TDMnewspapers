The Best Styles--
The Best Fabrics-
The Best Values-

THE STORY OF
BOUG CLOTHES

MONTHS before each new season begins, the orders
for Boug Clothes are placed. The best Clothing Malkers
know exactly what we expect-and because our. orders run
into many thousands of dollars these particular Clothing
‘Makers are particular about the way they turn out our
clothes.

The selection of materials is of prime importance.
Only the most.dependable are employed. Tailors who biave
served for years at their chosen line of work, who are Jpast
masters at their art, are then given these fabrics and they
fashion them into the newest styles, and their worknmian-%
ship must come up to the Boug standard.

Styles for men and young men are carefully studiied.
and you may be sure when the finished garments cone tb
this store they express the highest types of ready-for-sser-
vice clothes. #2

IN OUR monster showing of Suits every detail has
been painstakingly worked out. The slope of the shojuld-
ers, the cut of the vest, the fit of the trousers around! the
waist, the set of the garment, the linings, the buttonholes,
every minor detail Nas been finished under the skillful
watchfulness of men who know just how suits should be
made, if the suits are to spell complete satisfaction for the
men who are to, wear them.

There are conservative styles and thesmore Snappy
kind for the younger men and the youthful looking suits
for men who do not wish to show their exact age. Tlhere
are Belter models and Waist-line styles, in fact every mew
tailoring and stylé-idea is expressed in these suits. There
are patterns for men who prefer the quiet air and the live-
ly patterned suits for the young men who demand this later
kind. You'll find the greatest showing of good suits ever
before assembled on one floor in: one store in Western
