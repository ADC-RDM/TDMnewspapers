FLUE-CURING TOBACCO.

. ESRI,

The growing of flue<cured tobacco In
Canada dates tack to the first experi:
ment conducted by Messrs. Fox Broth-
ors in the vicinity of Ruthven, Ont,
where very light sandy loains, some-
what gravelly, were first devoted to
that type of leaf. From Ruthven |t
rapidly extended to the “very light
gandy logms along the lake shore,
which proved very suitable for the
raising of tobacco of the Bright Vir
ginin type. 3

The area that cAn be devoted to the
growing of that leaf in Canada {8 rath-
or limited. In Eastern Canada we can
hardly expect to see the culture of the
flue cured tobacco extended to other
parts than Southern Ontario,-as this
is the only tobacco district where the
season is suficlently long and warm
to allow the full ripening of the leaves
before they are taken to the kiln. As
to the possibilities of British Colam-
bia for that type of tobacco they have
not yet been considered. Therefore,
it 18 very probable that the growing
Af. that type of leaf will become a spec-
falty in the hands of tha farmers who
own land mally suitable for this pur-
pbse. The ice of Tand on which flue
tobaceo can Ie grown has considerably
increased dining the last few years.
and has now neacifed the price paid
for orchard lmid in the ‘friut belt of
| me Niagara pminsula,

While an overproduction of White
Burley was sxperienced In Canada a
few years ag, i8 can be sald that, ow-
ing to the linited acreage that can be
devoted to fhe.prowing of flue-cured
tobacco, this med hardly be feared as
far as the latler type is concerned.
Phe growing of fluetobacco in South
Ontario.s therfore one of the safest
undertakings.

Apart from he guccessful curing of
the crop.-in_ordwr to obtain as large a
proportion of bright leaf as possible,
the most importint problem at present
Is the maintenance or even the im-
provement of the fertility of the solls
devoted to bright tobacco, Generally
the fertility of those very light sands
js much below the average, in fact
the best fand’ for flue tobacco in On-
tarlo Iras besn found where It is prac-
tically Impossible to raise successiul-
ly any other crop except, in some in-
stances, tomatoes or other vegetables,
at the cost of very heavy applications
of manure and fertilizers. But it is
better to forsee that war cgffditions
will not be long maintainedsnnd that
with normal prices the n return in
nloney per acre might infa few years
fall short of what it has been for "the
last two or three seasons, unless a ser-
{ous ‘effort 1s made with a view to in-
creasing the yield per acre while main-
taining the quality of the leaf

This {8 the main problem which we
are trying to solve at present The
objective of the grower of flue tobacco
should be to obtain the best color and
the maximum possible yleld at the
same time. This will require the
maintenance) of *the fertility of the to-
bacco land to a nice degree of equil-
ibrium«so as to prevent the leaf be-
coming loo coarse tor a successful
curing.

On the other hand, the curing pro-
cess by itself requires expert handling,
the knowledge of which so far, at least
In Canada, has been mastered by very
few.

A comprehensive description of the
curing process, as far ag conditions in
South Ontario are concerned, will be
found in the first part of the bulletin.
There 18 no absofhtg rule, as much de-
pends upon the condition of the crop
at the time it ia taken into the Kiln
and the weather conditions during the
process, Still; we believe it will be
possible for the Ontario grower of
flue-cured {obacza to Tderive much
benefit from the comments on the
methods” of curing as practised at
Harrow. ‘In our opinion this is the
first dntelligent and practical descrip-
tion of the flué‘curing proceds so far
published In Canada dealing with
special conditions Jin South Ontario.

As will be noted by the reader, the
soil of the Tobazeo Station at Harrow
{5 considered a little too heavy for the
growing of the brightest leaf, but, even
fn spite'of ‘the unfavorable weather
conditions of ths last few years, a
«comparatively large proportion of
bright leaf kas been obtaiped, If this
has been possible on ont’ Tobacco Sta-
tion It can also be done elsewhere.
Thif gratifying colclusion cannot be
too much emphasized as, If the de-
mand for ‘Canadian flue-curéd tobacco
fncreases to the extent that the best
land will pot suffics to meet it, it will
be necessary to grow the balance on
land slightly heavier in texture, which
in ‘the hands: of sskiliful growers will
produce flue 1obaeco bf marketable
quality.

Moreover, there {s not merely an
active demand for fenlly bright leaf,
but other grades of flue tobacco like
the bright red and red. can also find
a ready market in Canada. . Those
darker grades are psed for special
purposes, which faquires a heavier
leaf, more efistic' syd gummy, that can
hardly, be produced: on the lghtest
type of soll.

We may, therefore, look in the near
future for a classification of flue to-
bpccos Into brights and reds, with pos-
ably Beveral grades of each. .

While the first Sart of this bulletin
deals especially vith conditions atthe
Harrow Tobacco Station, as far at
least as the type of soil 18 concerned,
the second part sontains.a more gen:
eral description ol the soils that are
most suitable and of tht methods to be
followed for raising & crop of good
quality without inpainiig the fertility
of the-land. = * ? -,
