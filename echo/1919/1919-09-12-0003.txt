Fletcher’s Castoria is strictly a remedy for Infants
Foods are specially prepared for babies, A els Wa.

a remedy for the common ailments of Infants and Children

What is CASTORIA?

Castoria is a harmless substitute for Castor Oil, Paregoric
Drops and Soothing Syrups. It is pleasant, It pin
neither Opium, Morphine nor other narcotic substance, Its

been in constant use for the relief of Constipation, Flatulency
Wind Colic and Diarrhoea; allaying Feverishness arising
therefrom, and by regulating the Stomach and Bowels, aids”
the assimilation of Food; giving healthy and natural clegs,
