The North End branch of the Lad-
les" Gulid met at the home of Mrs,
Wm. Otter last week. The Middle (g-
land branch have ' not as yet con-
vened at any home, although they ex-
pect to in the near future,

The voters’ list for the coming elac-
tion Is all fixed up. and the ladles, who
have been kept in the background
since Adam mide. his appearance, will
now come Into thefr.own. Truly this
old world is duo fora big change.

The threshing bee at Ernest Clut-

ton's will live in the minds of those |.!

who took part as well as the proprie-
tor for along time to come. Unlooked
for and unforeseen accidents came
thick and fast; everything . went
through the machine from a six-inch
bolt to a petrified corn stalk; teeth
from the clyinder were flylng pro-
miscuously around in every ddrection,
until at last: Theodore decided to tie
binder twine around each tooth ta
keep them from hitting the feeder,
However, like everything else, things
came to an end, and the job was com-
plete, and everyone went home rejoic-
ing, although Mr. Clutton. will never
forget the experlence, The amount
threshed was 966. bushels of whent,
which is only a fraction of his crops,
wilich were gotten by hard work, per:
severance and sticktoitiveness, The
most surprising thing is that Mr. Clut-
ton lives a“single, life; no wife to glad-
den _his heart or help him over the
stony paths in life, and-how he ralsed
such a bountiful crop under such un-
surmountable clrenmstances Is, to Say
the least, a miracle,

Claude Quick, one of our most entar-

there was not a prouder man on the
island than Claude when the patch
came to maturity But Claude “was
not the only one alive to the beauti-
ful patch. Boys—m yous boys—

the luscious melons ware heady to

Claude. The result was one of fhe
