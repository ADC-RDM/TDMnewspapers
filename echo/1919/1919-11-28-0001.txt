|EITHER KEEP AWAY -

FROM DETROIT

{
Or Be Vaccinated.

 

If the present order placing a small
pox quarantine against all Canadians
entering Detroit from! Ontario lasts
for 30 days, Christmas ghopping plans
in the Michigan city will be all shot.
Effective since Wednesday, every per-
son entering Detroit fram Windsor or
any of the horder citlds or towns in

the interlor of Canada, must either
submit to smallpox ccination or

|show a certificate of vaccination less

than three years old. These strin-
gent measures. were ordered on Tues-
day from Surg-Gen. Blue in Washing-
They were deemed imperative]
to prevent a spread of the smallpox
epidemic from Canada to the United
States, Smpllpox is said to be epl- |
demic in Pbronto and St. Catharines,
to be spreading westward.

 
 
 
  
  

It Is #stimated that 30,000 persons
pass between Windsor and Detroit
datly and to care for these vast

crowds an Impromptu clinic will be

| established at the Woodward avenue

dock of the Detroit & Windsop Ferry
Co, with a staff of public health ser-
vice doctors. to vaccinate persons
crossing from Windsor, | It is a ques-
tion if thelr desire to buy shoes and
wearing apparel in Detroit will em-
bolden the ladies to face the meedle.
In: the meantime a great search is

1| going on In many. Canadian households

for vaccination certificatds whith they

A most amusing progiiam was sup-
plied last Friday evening ati the Par-

ish Hall, Amherstburg, by .the enter.

tainment committee of the Amherst
burg Knights of Columbus, In a brief
and witty - speech Macomb. Mullen,

| president of the local Knights, bade

the audience, a goodly number of
Burgite fans, to expect gomething out
of the ordinary, He mada the playful
bonst that, whereas many entertain
ments would be giv in, the future
by the local Knights, mene of ‘them
could, hope to equnl the Initial per
formance, He purposely left the
hundred #r So men present; ing the
dork as to just what the nature of the
However,
everybody surmised that there would
be a boxing match, as an enormous
ring was the,most conspicuous thing
fn the hall. Sure enough tlie program
opened with a bout between two
sturdy Ittld descendants of Ham, And
hose those little kinky-headed' pickn-
ninnies did pound and pommel each
ather for three rounds, The first item
alone ‘ofthe program was enough to
repay the spectators for coming. But
gach successive Slunt waa quite «as
good as, if not better, than the first,
Perhaps the scream of the evening
was the ple-eating contest In which
Malf a dozen colored youngsters took
part. In this partiewlar item little
Henry Chambers proved tobeas good
as a clreus. SE Bértrand, who must
have put his money on Henry, see-
ing that the-midget was not devouring
his ple as fast as the rest, untied-his
arms, and Henry pitched in wiht both
hands, mouth and pockets in a desper-
ate effort” to make his pls disappear
first. The audience wmussq itself be-
tween. the acts by throwing penniés
into the ring and the colored young-
sters reaped a harvest. If little Henry
won in no other contest, lig certaimy
gathered the most cash, haying some-
thing like three dollars in his posses-
slon when the night's fup closed.
Alex. Duff acted as referee |p géveral
bouts, much to the =setistaction of
