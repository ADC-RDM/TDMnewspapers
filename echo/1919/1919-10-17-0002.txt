LL. P. Wigle, opening his remarks,
said that for the first time in the his.
tory of South Essex the Government
in power had no candidate, and that
was the reason hefwas to speak firse.
He was elected-on” Juno 29th, 1914, on
the Liberak platform. which he had
Iived-up to, Including several important

0 exercise

the
whole
Wer

"planks. among which was the abolition

of the bar. He spoke in favor of that
jssue- on every platform. His oppon-
ents sald he was not sincere and he
wits opposed. but in 1915. at the first
session of the Legislature he attend-
ed, he supported a resoliition brought
in by the Liberals to abolish the bar,
but the Government voted it down. In
1916 the ©, T. A. was brought in«by
the Government, and that was sup-
ported by the Liberal party, and he
hadn't met one man In South Essex
wha _zrld he wanted to go back to the
old conditions, for the O. T. A. has
worked wonders in the county.. An-
otheryplank in the Liberal platform of
1314 was “Votes for Women,” This
was introduced fn the House by’ the
Liberals in 1916 and 1917, and laughed
at by the Government supporters, but
in 1918 the Government turned face
and introduced the bill themselves,
and the Liberals joined with the Gov-
ernment in passing the Act. Hei be-
lieved that this wanld result jn the
ladles cleaning up the country politi
cally. He expected the women 10 re-
giprocate by voting for him.. The next
plank was the Good Roads, He advo
cated making*a fund from the autos
mobile license money, and ia the next
five years, veryilittie more would be
needed. He criticized the Govern-
ment for not giving more information
about the kind of roads, the cost, étc,
before they appropriated the money.
Now. no one knows the kind of road,
where -it is going, or anything else
about it. It's very popular te be a
farmer at the present time (laughter).
He was a farmergthere should be
‘more fn the LegMature. buf there
are other classes in the country besides
the farmer. He never knew & man to
be turned down on account of his pro-
tedsion. We want no class legislation.

than any other time, when there {§ 50

he advocated the Government advance

the farm, becsuse we have to have
more production If we are to get
cheaper living. Regarding returned
soldiers settlement, he criticized the
Gavernment for trylng to settle sol-
diers in New Ontario. They should

have all the privileges. He belloved
the Province was spending too much

money for the returns they were got:

omy. The speaker then kidded Lewis

patriotism. [| want to say, I've been
a true blue and stayed by the guns al}
through the war.” Closing Mr. Wigle
made light of the claim of Lewis Wig-
le that he had got $169.000 for Essex
connty when he was member, No priv-
ate member can get any money. These
bills must come from a member of the
Cabinet. He made a strong plea for
the electors to support him next Mon-
day for the principles he advocated.

M. C. Fox spoke briefly. He
thought Mr. Wigle, as member, should
have advocated more measures in the
interests of the farmer. [If he were
elected, he would recommend a revis-
fon in" the Asgessment Act whereby
improvements on farm buildings
shonld not be taxed; he favored an
exemption dor farm buildings up to
$2,000. In this way greater production
would be encouraged, nd the High cost
of living reduced. As it is now, if a
farmer paints his ‘building, the as-
sésdor boosts his assessment $200
or There should also be
legislation enabling farmers to go
fo their councils and barrow money
at a low rate of interest for improve-
cents, sume as they now gel money
for .tile drainage. But farmers are
also interested In good Jive towns, and
he thought that in urban’ municipali-
ties houses should be exémpt from as-
sessment up to $1.000. Our returned
soldiers deserve the best there is, and
as far as they are eligible should re-
celve appointment to public offices,
There is nothing in the cry that far-
mers are seeking class legislation, and
those who say there is no room for a
farmers’ party in Parlinment had bet-
ter make robm, for there's, going to
be a lot of them there next session.
He was “lour square” on the Releren-
dum, and (in anawer to a question
from the audience) said he was In
favor of Hydro Radials.

Lewis Wigle, as was expected, sup-
plied the comedy for the occasion. He
had for years appeared on this plat-
form appealing for support for others
Now ‘he wanted their support. flor him-
self. Though up in years he had more
strength and more sense than ever,
and had been saving his strength for

and that the Government would pay 85

Lambert Wigle closed the meeting
in & short reply, during which he in-
formed Mr. Fox that the assessment
exemption on farm buildings was al
ready on the gintute books by way of
Jocal option. in municipalities, The
Libérals always stood for prohibition

one of the planks in their platform for

Mr. Powers—"You took that from
the National Council of Agriculture.”

Mr. Wigle—'The National Council
of Agriculture wasn't in existence in
Ontario five years ago.”

Continuing, Mr, Wigle sald that the
Liberals had advocated local option in
asses8ing farm buildings, and we now
have it. So far as Mr. Fox's plea is
concerned - to‘ support him because
he is the farmer's condidate, when In

rejected the farmer and supported the
professional man.
