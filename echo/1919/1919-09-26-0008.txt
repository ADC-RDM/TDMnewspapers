= VERY farmer should care for

his farm buildings in such a
way as to maintain them in
good serviceable condition
and 80 conserve. his resources gen-
erally. On most farms there ar
many details fn themselves of minor
importance, but in the aggregate of
tremendous -influence. Carelegsness
of the exterior of buildings is an in-
dication, generally, of the conditions
Slovenly
surroundings and general run-down
conditions are the hall-marks of in-
eptitude and mismanagement.

The farmer may not be, able to
change the location of his farm, |
but to a great extent he can
control ‘its pppearance and géneral
conditions by seeing that the roofs
are in good repair and weather tight.
the fences in place, gates in order
and painted, on hinges, not sagging

or dragging on the ground, the
latches and hinges of all doors and
gates greased and operating freely;
no broken lights In the window
sashes of the various bulldings; the
stable fixtures in order, the stanch-
jons and partitions in place, and the
mangers and floor in good repair,
giving to the whole place the impres-
sjon that it receives prudent care and
regular attention. +i

Investigations have disclosed the

fact that concrete is an ideal material

 

 

for repairing and making in the
hands of a resourceful person on the
farm. Publications issuéd by cement
manufacturers as to tools and ma-
terials. used, aggregates, proportion-
ing the mixture, how to mix, how to
plan forms, reinforcement, etc., may
be obtained for the asking.

Doors—The ordinary stable door
construction of two thicknesses of
matched lumber is not satisfactory,
because the effect of the warm moist
alr of the stable on the inside ply
of lumber causes it to swell, while
the outer lumber, being less affected,
cases the door to $pring out top and
bottom. panelled door Is less af-
fected because the expansion and
contraction resulting from atmos-
pheric conditions is taken up by the
panels.

To hang a dbor hold it up against
the jambs amd mark round with a
pencil. 'Fhen cut down to these lines. ;
Make it 34 nmrrower and 3% shorter.
The hinges should ‘be placed about
six inches from the top and the lower
one ten inches from the floor. The
thickness of the casing should be
taken from the total width of the
hinge, the. balance, divided by two,
gives the distance the hinge Is to set
baék from the face side of the door.
In all cases tive hinge should be wide
enough (0 reach across two-thirds of
the thickness of the door. ~~ Heavy
dodrs should have three hinges. The
mortise for the hinge' of the door
should bevel; slighdy toward the
front! so that the hingg will uot
strike the jamb.

Setting locks for the door — Rim:
Jocks are thosé that are simply
screwed-.on to the face of the door.
Mortise lotks are those set into a
mortise in the door jtself, The rim

for keyhole, kknob-bdr hole, and screw
holes, The first two fre cut and the
last are bored and the lock screwed:
into place. The escutcheon and knob-
plates are put on, and the keeper in
