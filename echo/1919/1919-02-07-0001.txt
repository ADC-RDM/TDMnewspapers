DEATH OF THOMAS SQUIRE,
Thomas Squire, prosperous retired
farmer, died at Leamington on Satur-
day in“the 77th year of his nge. He
had been in strong and vigorous health
until Inst fall, whens he, suffered se-
vera Injuries sustained {n an nutomo-
bile accident, and from that time ho
began to fall. The Squire family is
one of the well known Ynd
most widely diffused families of
Essex County, the, first of that
name coming to tlils peninsula
nearly a century ago, and settling in
the vielilty of Olindn, Gosfield South,
Ho was Thomas Squire, sr., father of
the subject of this sketch, and of
eleven children that were born to him
only two survive, Mrs. Joseph Robin-
son, of Kssex, and Mrs. Dowler, of
Maryland. ‘Tho others were: The
late Mrs, James Hilllazd, Wm. Squire,
John ‘Squire, the Iafe Mis. Joseph
Fox, of Amherstburg; Mary , Ann
Squire, Naomi (Mrs. William Bororw-
man, of Anderdon,). Melvina Squire,
Thomas Squire spent his whole
life (until he retired in 1903) in farm-
ing near Olinda. He was married

three times, first to Rebecca D. Cum-
miford, who, bore him two children:

Minnfe Alzora (deceased), and Cecelln-

May (Mrs, A. H. Wood), of Gosfield
His second marriage was to Mary
Jones, and they had two children:
Ernest Wilford and Howard Earle,
His third wife was Phoebe Smith, of
Rochester; there are no children by

Mr. Squire was a- consistent member
of the Methodist church and the fun-

realdence, were conducted by the Rev.
L. W. Hill, pastor of the Leamington
Methodist * chureh._ Burial = was at
Olinda, under the auspices of Beaver
Lodge, No. 82, 1.O.O.F., of which he
had been a member for many years.
By nature Mr. Squire was of a very
genial disposition and the popularity
and high esteem {in which he ‘was
held wa evidenced by the very large
number who attended his funeral. It
should be mentioned in this connection
that the County Council two years ago
purchased the gravel pit on part of
the old Squire homestead Olinda,
and from this 1s taking the metal for

DRAINAGE COURT.
_ Drainage Referee Henderson held
courtiat Sandwich this week. One of
the most important chses was the ap-
peal made by! the. County of T¥wex
against the n#sessment for the Fou-
cher drain on the townline between
Malden and Anderdon. This drain was
being put through by Malden, and as
part .af {tL Is on the townline, whi¢h
was assumed by the = county as a
county road, the engineer's reports
were altered, séveral times at the sug-
gestion of the Good Roads Superinten-
dent, and later an appeal was entered.
A compromise judgment. was rendered
to the effect that the assessment on
thd Townline Road charged to the
county was reduced $200 and placed
on the 3rd and 4th concession roads
of Malden, while Malden pays the
costs, "which are to be charged to the
roads, owned by the township, assess-
ed in the drain.

Schools South Essex, is ‘paying his

—An 80-acre tract, known asthe
David Clark farm, near the projécted
steel company of Ojibway, was sold
to a synlicate of Chicago and Detroit
capitalists at a price said to have,
been close to $2,500 an acre

—A rumor is flsating around to the
effect that the Wibash will not renew
its: contract with the G. T. R. in Can-
adn, but will ran its trains between
Walkerville and’ St. Thomas over the
Pere Marquette. If. this would” come
to pass, it would make the Canadian
Division of the Pere Marquette a real
railroad,

wich and Ford wil be merged intc a
single municipality - with all ‘the ad-
vantages jn reduction of municipal
operating "costs hat such an amalga-
