BEING
CLEVER,

[00
By HILDA MORRIS

(Copyright, 18, by the MeClure Newsy
wy Dor Byndicate.)

Emily was a very clever girl. Byery
one had always sald so, from her ador
{og aunt, who taught her the alphabet,
to her sociology professor in the uni-
versity. She was pretty, too, or rather,

s 48 her butterfly cousin, Kate, once re-

marked, “she, would be stunning If

she'd glve herself half a chance.” That
wns the trouble with Emily. In any
save Intellectual directions she never
gave herself half a chance. She had
never felt the slightest interest In boys
and ‘men except as tenchers and hu-
man beings with worth-while minds.

At twenty-two Emily was that anom-

aly among womankind, a girl who had

never had any sort of love affair.

True, there had been one or two young

men in her classes who would havo

liked to go farther than mere acquaint.
ance, but Emily had never given them
| the slightest encouragement. -
When she went to vieit Kate last
summer it was not because she wished
to share in the social life of which
Kate formed so capricious a part, but
simply because she thought that Kate's
home {n a small town would be a good,
quiet place where she could work on
her theals undisturbed.
However, Pmlly twas mistaken
There was not an evening when the
veranda was not filled with gay youth
come to pass the time, or there was not
a dance at the club, a party or a play.
The days were just as full; tennis,
“Joy rides” with one of Kate's ridicu-
lous boys, pienles, tens—In short Emily
found that she would have to state her
| purpose in life quite flatly and ask
| Kate to count her out. So she sat in
| her room one afternoon, trying to con-®

centrate ona thick volume with a for-
| midable title, while the sounds of gay
volces drifted up to her from the ve-
randa below.

Kate was there, of course, and two
or three other girls. Also two young
men who should, thought Emily, have
been In better business. There was
something quite demoralizing about
the sound of their apparent pleasure.
Emily found it hard to work. Not that
she envied them, rather she felt sorry
for them, poor frivolous things! She
closed her book and sat with her eyes
on space, thinking absently.

“Where's your cousin?” she heard
one of the men ask suddenly. J

“Emily? Oh, she's boning over her
old books, at least she sald she was
going" to.” |

“Poor thing!” commented another
girl. “I feel sorry for her. Just becnuse
she isn't attractive and popular I sup-
pose she has to be intellectual. It
must be an awful strain!” :

“I should say so,” spoke up a third
girl. “I felt awfully sorry for her the
other night at that picnic. Everybody
else paired-off and had a good time.
She looked awfully lonesome.”

“Well” there was a shrug n Kate's
voice. “I've done my best. I can't help
it if she Isn't popular» Besides, I think
she r lly Nkes to study. You can’t
do anything for a girl Hire that.”

Emily felt her face burn scarlet. So
they were sorry for her! Sorry for
her! Why, she had thought the pity
all on her, own side. How dared
they?

The voices below were rumbling on.

“They say Grant Sturgis is ¢oming
home next week. I haven't seen him
for years, but they say he Ig perfectly
stunning and an awful heart-smasher.
There's some one‘to set your.oup for,
Kate, He has londs and loads of
money.” }

It was right then, in anger and the
| spirit of revenge, that Emily concélved
| her remarkable plan. To think was to
! act with Emily, and she loct no time
in writing orders in to various city
stores. Within a few days mysterious
boxes began to arrive for her, tlie con-
tents of which she kept secret. If
Kate wondered about them it was
without a great deal of Interest. Books
no doubt, or some more of thowe.im-
‘possible tailored skirts and flnt-hetled
shoes that Emily siways wore.

There was to be an Informal dance
at the Country’ club one' evening a
week later. Rather to Kate's surprise,
Emily sald thst ghe thought she should
like to go.

“Could you get a man for me?’ she
asked her preity cousin.

“Oh, yes, of course. There's Emmett
Brown; will he do? “I'm going with
‘| Murray Jones myself, but when I" get

there—1

just one man I want to flirt with" to-
night, and that's Grant Sturgis. He's
the best looking and" rizheést man in

Elmville, sand all the girls are wild |

about him. I want to mt them out.”

“You doubtless will,” Emily encour-
aged her; with an o&f little smile.

Kate was so interested in her own
dazzling tollet tha: she never stopped
to wonder what ¥mily might wear.
Indeed, she went off with her escort
before Emily was ready, and did not
gee her until after the second dance,
And when se did see her she was'not

at all sure that it could be Emily.

“Who's ‘that girl over there; the
stunning one In yellow with her back
towards us?” she asked Emmett
| Brown, with whom she was danchug.

: Well, fou ought to-know “it's your

own tous, She looks mighty: nice | ¢

| tonight, 00." Kf ATI

. Emily turned around Just then and
| Kate gaspid. Was this Emily, of the

daliity feet were eafin-clnd, ani she
danced divinely, Mare than that, she
was dancing with Grant Sturgls, and
he appeared to be enjoying It!

As the evening slipped by, Kate
found thnt Emily danced very fre-
quently with Grant Sturgis. Indeed,
Kate herself had only one dance with
him, and his conversation during that
time ‘was chiefly about her beautiful
cousin. Kate decided that he was not
go very handsome, after all, and If he
was queer enough to bé fadeinated by
A blue-stocking ke Bmily— *

Yes, she looks lovely tonight,” Kate
assented rather grudgingly. “I wish
she would do it oftener, I hope shé
hasn't bored you talking soclology.”

“Sociology?” he echoed in surprise.
“She hagn't, no. Does she—go In for
that? X judged she was a butterfly
kind of girl.”

And Knte was too amazed to an-
BWer.

When Emily came home that night
she was a very radiant and lovely
Emily. Kate was waiting for her, in no
very pleasant mood

“Well,” was Kate's greeting, “I hope
you had a good time, You got the lion
of the evening all right. Why didn't
you tell me you had that dress?”

Emily looked at her in mild spr
prise.

“It didn’t oecur to me,” she sald.
“I'm sorry, Kate, if you mind because
I monopolized Mr, Sturgis. After what
you told me, perhaps it wasn't quite
fair. But you sbe—"

“What?”

“I happened to know that you all
thought I was an unattractive stick,
and I wanted to show you what I could
do.”

Kate's amazed look slowly widened
into an appreciative smile,

“Well,” she sald, “I guess you show-
ed us. Every girl there was green
with envy.”

“And what's more,” Emily went on,
“I hand an awfully good time. In fact
—Mr, Sturgis and I got so very well
acquainted that—I shouldn't wonder
but what I may decide to marry him,
08 he wants me to,”

“Oh, Emily!” murmured Kate, “I
always knew you were clever, but
this—, My, I guess clever people can
do Just about anything they want to,
can't they?”

BUILDS CHARACTER OF CHILD

Kindergarten One of the Most Valuanle
Features In the Scheme of
Education.

Kindergarten methods, whether be-
gun by the mother in her own home or
by the trained teacher in school, are
of Inestimable value to the child, for
character bullding ts always made thelr
principal aim and object.

Perhaps mothers may not have Yéen
trained In kindergarten methods, but
at least they can learn how to tell a
story. Anyone can read a story, but
telling one is much more effective and
much more enjoyable to the child, HEv-
ery mother should:learn how to tell
a story.’ Use your own words and
choose simple «nd T0rceful ones. A
bare plot is Interesting to the tiny
child, but many details should he SUp-

plied for the oldér boy and glx: they
love them. Use direct disconsse when
possible. Be enthnslistie. Be dra-
matie; After.the story is finished, talk
it over freely with the children. Choose
some storfes which teach kindness to
‘animals anf some which give training
In morale or.good habits, but never
point the moral.

A tasta for best literature ¢an often
be form:d in early childhood through
a wise cinice of stories. This is also
true of music. The songs and music:
used In the kindergarten are always
carefully selected by the kindergartner
and should be jist as carefully selected
for the home by mother. Allow your
children to hear only the best.

Besldes story tellig and music, there
are also pictures. Thoge which Inter-
estithe child most show action and
movement. Pitures are helpful be-
cause they devel the Imagination and
arouse the creathe faculties. 7

Games also ald in the great work of
cliaracter bullding. * They help. to de-
velop /self-expression and originality
ond can also be used to teach self-help-

fulness toward others. Through games |!

children may be made to discover the
evil effects of ‘self-will and the good
resulting from self-control.

Play a story. with your child. ‘Seo

how attemtive he will _be and what

powers of self-expression he possesses.
