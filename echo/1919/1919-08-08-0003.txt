Cool Comfort

Its Sunday morning—blazing hot, and pretty near
a whole day before you for rest and recreation.

First, then—a shave. Whether you are going for a
spin in the car, taking the family to chutch or visiting
a neighbour, you cannot go with a day's growth of
beard on your chin.

The thought of shaving won’t be irksome if you own
a Gillette Safety Razor—rather, you think of five
minutes’ cool comfort with the highest type of
shaving edge ever developed. No man in the world
can command a‘keener blade than the one you slip

into your Gillette. * .

And-if Gillette shaving gives you an added joy. to
your Sunday,whynot take five minutes everymorning
for a clean’shave as the start for a better day’s work.

Quaint Early Spring Wrap in Vene-
tian Red Bure, With Handsome Em-
broideries of Rough Gray Wool.

A lovely young actress“one of the
adored beauties of Paris—had Just
launched a most effectiva novelty. This
novelty takes-the form of a thick cord,
with lopg tassel, of bright scarlet silk,
In front there was an antique ornn-
ment, in plaque form, suspended from
the cord, and at the back a big tassel
welghted It dwn and made a splendid
flash of color. This idea was taken
from the scarlet cords and tassels
worn by choir boys In gome churches
on ccremonlous occasions.

The color of the ‘cord and tassel
was the brightest and most vivid sear-
let, the ornament In front being
of nm antique nature, with a slight
suggestion of “church” In {ts.compo-
sition. On the Lend wns one of the

Draw Hair Right Off Forehead.

It (becomes more and more the fash-
lon to draw the hair right off the fore-
head and to arrange It very high on
the top of the head, the only soft curls-
showing being those which thrust
themselvos forward over the ears. This
style of headdress Is very distin.
guished but rather trying to any one
who Is not possessed of a smal nose
nnd pretty. profile. But all gorts of
women, with all sorts of profiles; are
adopting the fashion of drawing the
hair away from the forehead, severely

lic tissue which are folded round the
