in the House of Comnions was a
painful shock. He had-been so re-

in his preparations for the business
of the session of Parliament which
is to open on Thursday. Only four
weeks ago he had attended the con-
vention of the Eastern Ontatio Lib--

dress in which he made the remurk,
“Every day I feel I am getting riper |
and riper for heaven.” A few weeks
ago he’ conferred with Sir Thomas

ness of the coming session. On Wed-
nesdny last agnin he discussed with
Hon. Charles Murphy a plan which’
the latter had prepared for lighten-
ing the Parlinmentary duties of the
Leader of the Opposition. On Satur-
day he attended the meeting of the
Ottawa Canadian Club, and he had
summoned a number of his leading
asgoclates in the Opposition in Par-
liament to mect him here to-day to
