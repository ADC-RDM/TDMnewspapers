GOOD CROPS HELP TO PRODUCE
PORK.

 

vations In Different Parts of the
Continent nnd Note Considerable
Lack of Knowledge — Alfnlfn
Needs Supplementary Ration and
Clover Proves Valuable.

“Gum shoe” farming for ham and
bacon production ‘does not presuppose
web-footed hogs. It merely means
that irrigation as practiced by some
western farmers involves conserva-
tive use of moisture for production of
forage crops which may be harvested
directly in the fields by the porkers,
The swine industry in the rubber-
boot country has been subject to per-
{ods of expansion and’ depression. One
cause Is lack of knowledge as to the
possibility of using aertain frrigated
fleld crops, and as to the value of
these crops when mensured In terms
of pork production, If full advantage
is taken of the wide range of feeds
available to swine growers on firri-
gated lands, pork production can be
and with

  

more assurance of succes:

Irrigation farmers Interested in
pork production have had to rely on
results obtained in nondirrigated sec-
tions, and applied to localities where
web-footed crops grow. This lack of
definite information was especially
noteworthy in the case of fleld crops,
which in other sections of the coun-
try are pastured by hogs or hogged

off. Hence, since 1912 specialists
have been making observations on

the.utilization of irrigated fleld crops
as hog pasture. These investigations
include pasture tests with 149 lots
consisting of 2,795 hogs pastured on
alfalfa, sweet clover; field peas, and
milo.

Pasturing alfalfa with hogs has
,been demonstrated a satisfactory
method of utilizing the forage, and
one of the cheapest ways to produce
pork. .Howeyer, to obtain satisfac-
tory results, the alfalfa pasture must
be supplemented-with some carbona-
ceous feed, such as a 2 per cent, ra-
tion of corn, barley, milo; wheat, or

Anyone would be loatl) to believe

that the farmers who of all classes, of
thé” community are most directly in-

to the present Loan, are apathetic.
More than oni-third of proceeds of
the last Loan wus spent directly-in the
purchase of Canadian wheat and other
food-stuffs, and resold to Great Brit-
ain and Allied countries on credit.
That (s to say $207,7560,000 of the
money subscribed a year ago went
into the pockets of the farmer; and
without these heavy purchases the
farmer would have been obliged to
dispoge of his surplus product at a
probable loss, The amonnt that will
be spent during the coming year in
financing credits to overseas purchas-
ers of Canad agricultural products
is wholly contingent on the extent of
the over-subscription to 18 year's
