George BE. McLean regretted that
he was compelled to retire. from the

M. Deslippe, who fathered the pur-
chase of the gravel pit, docided to
stand. It was & good bargain at 15
cents a, yard, instead of paying 60
cents, as ‘had been done for years.
He urged the ratepayers to support

would have money to spend on getting
this gravel on %he roads. (

W. A. Barnet advised the ratepay-
ers to give the by-law hearty support.
To do qtherwise would be a retrograde
movement as our roads need improve-
ment. Mr. Barnet announced that he
would stand for the reeveship.

Mr. Madill stated that If the by-law
