The United Farmers of Ontario are
in full support of the Victory Loan, as

he farmers of Ontario:

o the farmers of Ontario:
Tome Victory Loan, 1919, is of vilgy
Interest to the farmers of the Provincy
of Ontario. This will be readily recog.
nized when it is realized that of thy
total praceeds of the 1918 loan over
$200,000,000," or 34 pery cent. of the
loan, was advanced to Great Britain
and he rallies for the purchase of
Canadian wheat and other fobdstuffs.
