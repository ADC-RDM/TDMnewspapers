Charges preferred by H. Hartley

administration of the Ontario License
Comnulssion, and in particular againsty

clared to be without foundation’ by

2 No foundation for charges with

8. No. foundztion for charges with
reference to the Slavin case,

4. Liquor was sent to Homer for no
improper purpose, but to ald well-cen-
celyed plans to enforce the law.

5. Morrison was a capable officer,
but his failure to Inform tae Commis-
slon of his connection with the detect.

6, Charges made by Employers’ De-
tective Agency were reasonable.

PIGS MAKE SLOW GAIN
HOGGING DOWN RYE

Hogging dowd Tye is an unprofitable
practice according to tests made in
pork production at the Ohfo Experi-
ment Station. The tests show that
it is generally mere profitable to har-
vest the grain and sell it as a cash
crop or to feed the grain to hogs after
threshing rather than to allow the
logs to harvest the grain themselves.

Specialists pomt out’ that the daily
ncrease per’ p§ when hogging dewn
rye is generaly less than half a pound
and that the amount of grain required
to produce 10 pounds gain is much
higher than Where the grain ia fed
