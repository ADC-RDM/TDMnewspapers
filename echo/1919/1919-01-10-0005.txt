In the case of Memphis, the conse-
quences of the river cutting a new
channel several miles west of its pres-
ent bed and leaving a city of more
than 100,000 population stranded weld
be so serlous that the government has
come to the rescue of the threatened
town, Immense carpets of willow
branches, firmly’ fastened together,
have beén lald over the bed of the
stream. These great carpets, heavily
weighted with stone; sink to the bot-
tom,

The carpets when properly laid are
ploned In place by plles driven down
through them deep Into the bed of the
river, That stops the erosion of the

river bed and keeps the channel in
