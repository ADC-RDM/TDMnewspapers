Impulse That Rules Yellow. People
Keeps Nation From Extinction

A White Men Cut Little Figure

ee In Vast Land.

The procreative impulse rules China
as the Manchus never ruled it. Three
out of four bables dle, but the fourth
is more than enough. Kill 100,000,000
Chinese and In two generations there
are more graves cluttering the earth,
but as many living as ever,

The principal prodnct of China is
cheap, ricefed men, who work and
starve, or perhaps freeze to death In
the cold January nights, or dle by the
hundreds of thousands in’ periodical
famines, or obstinately survive and
raise more cheap, rice-fed men. There
are hundreds of millions of them with
vision bounded by a bowl of rice and
(he desire of male offspring. The race
1s like the sea, inexhaustible, Imperish-
able. It does not wither awd§vat the
breath of western civilization. It does
not disappear, It does not go uader.
It persists.

It is, moreover, an impermeable
race; to attempt to Interpenetrate it is
as hopeless as to pour water into a
jar filled with mercury. I thought of
Macao, Walter E. Weyl writes In
Harper's Magazine. The Portuguese
have been there more than three cen-
turies and have contrived to make of
It a beautiful city, living on oplom,
gambling and other devices, lke a
pretty prostitute In pink ribbons. The
plcturesque streets have Portuguese
oames, but the city is Irredeemably,
analterably Chinese, Look down from
the green-clad hills upon the flat roofs,
blue and green and red, of the clus-
tered, wind-swept city, and you see
the homes not of Portuguese, but of
Orientals. “Of a population of 75,000,
only ‘a scant 2,000 claim a dublous
Portuguese origin. :

The same is true of Hongkong, with
Its British bund and its foreign banks,
and its few thousand white-faced men
surrounded by swarming Chinese, . In
the Hongkong city of Victoria, which

tion, Wm. 1roudfoot, the Liberal lead-
er, strongly @bjected to the clause per-
mitting a member of the Ontario Rail:

way and 2qiicipal Board to be the

Director of yunicipel Affairs. Mr.
Proudfopt said that he felt the position
of a memhbr of the Raflway Board
was sufficie’tly Important for one
man. He #80 objected to the pay-
ment of two 8alaries, It Is understood
that J. A, Els, of the Rallyay Board,
is to be appointed the Director of
Munncipal ATairs, and in the event of
his being allowed to occupy the dual
position he Would be entitled to a
double salary. “I don't believe it is
in the public utereat that he should be
[allowed to draw two ealarics,” sald
Mr. Proudfo?t. The Premier defend-
ed the Government's proposal on the
ground .of th® desirability of co-ordin-
ating the werk of the Reallway Board
and Munfe!Pal Bureau.

CONSERVATIVE .PREFERS  ROW-
ELL LIQUOR POLICY.

The thrill of last week was caused
by the bolting of Col. H. A. C, Machin,
ConseryatiVe member for Kenora, who
took the epportunity of the Speech
from the ‘Throne address to denounce
the Ontaflo Temperance Act and the
precent Conservative Government,
The speaker stated that he was sorry
that he did not support Fon. Mr. Row-
ells’ “Abolish the Bar” measure a few
years ago. That was the proper thing
to do; the people in the Province had
no use fof the bar. The Colonel main-
tained that the Government should
compensate the liquor people who had
been put out of business by the On-
tario Teniperance Act. He also sug-
gested a Aystem of Government ven-
dors to sell liquor in each manicipal-
ity. He was layish in his praise of the
late Sir James Whitney and strong in
his denunciation of the present Hearst
government. .

FIRST DIVISION IN TWO SESSIONS

The first division since’ the gession
of 1917 took place during the debate
on the Speech from the Throne, when
‘an amendment proposed by Mr, De-
wart, demanding a return to the old
municipal procedure for the prepara-
tion of voters’ lists, was voted down
by a straight party vote of 58 to 25.

more than 640,000 to the square mile

This the Day of Young Men,

In their enthusiasm, some well
stricken In years have been heard to
argue that this ought to be called the

to be not only old but: foolish to at-
tempt to" make that out. Youth will
still be served. It Is really moré ém-
phaticiilly than ever before the day of

of handling bye-elections during the
last couple of years. He expressed
curiosity~as ‘to the proposed amend-
ments to the Ontarfo Temperance Act,
and deplored the fact that there was
no prospect of the one mill war tax
boing removed. In regard to the war

tax, however, the Provincial Treas- |

urer subsequentiy intimated that the
same would be discontinued.

The debate on the Address was com-
pleted on Wednesday, and the House
has now settled down to business,
