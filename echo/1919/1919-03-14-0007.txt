| Th Girl Under
the Hill

By 1ONALD ALLEN

(Copyright, 1018, by McClure Nowunpaper
Byndjate.)

Travelers who ¢me that way and
ascended and descaded the long hill,
with the creek andthe bridge at its
foot, nlwnys turned thér heads to look
at the old stone house pult In colonial
Gays, In summer it wis civered with
vines and stood fn the shade of the
pear trees, and in summer the “girl ut
der the hill” ‘wan oftenest caught
sight of. ~ hi

Why the “girl under the hill” insted
of Molly: Thatcher? Well, travels
would have it go, and nobody kntW
just why. She had been called so ol
sixteen, and she was still belng called
80 at twenty. It wns necessary only

{ to Inquire af apy house In the village
beyond the creek to know she was the
deughter. of old Mart Thatcher, the
pensioner, and a motherless girl.

Sometimes travelers saw the old
{ man on the porch and the dsughter
| rending to him 08 he smoked bis pipe;
sometimes she wns working among
the flowers In the yard: eymetimes
from the open Windows of the house;
they heard het singing and paused to
listen. . When strangers met her on
the road as she went to and from the
village with her basket, they remem-
bered that she had hale that shone
like gold In the sun, and a month that
smiled, and eyes that reminded them
of those of a deer. Sometimes, when
| n_too-curious young man pestered the
postmistress for information he re-

ceived the reply +

“She's smart and handsome and
good, and t's no use for you to waste
your time, Molly has never looked
at any fellow swice.”

One summer day the girl under the
bill carrled an apronful of weeds

, from the flower beds out of the gate

| and emptied , them in the highway.

| Just as_she dld so an auto driven b

| 4 young man came chugging up

| hill. - She looked fairly into he

! young man's eyes, and he into hers.

| The look did not last ten seconds, but it
| made her heart beat faster us she

turned away, and his as he continued
| his journey.

An hour later, the old father hob-

[ bled out on the porch where the girl

' eat with her chin on her hand, staring
{nto vacancy, and sald:

“I thought you might have gone to
the store. I haven't heard: you sing-

“I was just—just thinking,” she re-
plied as she got up and ron awny.

Autos were not a rare sight on that
highway. 'A dozen passed up or down
the hill every day, and no one minded
them. - The girl under the hill had
never gone to the gate out of curlos-
ity. If seated on the porch she had
not raised her eyes. All at once, now,
she found herself listening, and was
vexed. She found herself.at the gate,
and stamped her foot as she turned
sway. Thot young man had black,
hair and dark eyes: he was young and
hondsome; he was surely -a gentle-
man; he—. Bat to-break the chaln of
thought, Molly. gelzed the broom and
began to sweep the porch so vigorous-
ly: that-her father called out from the
fnterior of the house: :
| “Hey, girl, What's the matter with
» "you today? You swept the porch only
Yan hour.ago. Better save the broom.”

Two days had gone by since Mollie
Lad thrown the weeds in the rond and
the young man In the auto came again.
The girl was training a vine at the
corner of the honse, and she heard

gnd begin {o climb the hill. Yes, it
was the sap young ann; and he was
looking her way. She was partly
turned away, but she knew he was
Jooking. She heard ‘the machine al-
most come to a stop, but she would
pot Jook up. Then the power was In-
created, the ghug went louder and
faster, and she stood and listened un-
til the sounds dled away in the dis-
tance. “e

“That fellow pretty near got stuck
on the hi” Said the father as Molly
came around ia the porch.

It was just 05 well for “that fel-
lcw” that he Wigan't there to see the
| toss of her head ard the snap in her
eyes. She belleven that he had al-
most stopped to state at her, and she
was rejoiced that per attitude had
been one of disdain.

That 1s, after thinking it over, she
didn’t know-whather she was or not.

Three days later, as she sat sewing

| and her father glept in his rocker, she
heard an 8ut0 ggcend, the hill and
stop in fropt of the house. The rose
bushes bid it from her sight, but a
moment ater the dark-haired young
man Was standing uncovered: before
her and Eiying: | * “

“I beg Your pardon, miss, but could

oLast year there were two or three
aceldents along here, and it took the
men half a day to make repairs. If
they've got machines fiow that they
can repair with an old ax in ten min-
utes it's a big gain. I guess there's
some buttermilk from the churning
this morning, und if—"

“Phanks—thanks, but I must be go-
ing. Very kind of you, indeed.”

If the old pensioner's eyes had not
been so dim he might have seen n
young man blushing like a girl as he'
walked towards the gate, but he
didn't gee, and In his hospitality he:
called out:

vCal ngain any time yom break
down. If I ain't out here, take the ax
and use it as long as you want to.”

“father, how could you spenk that
way to him?” exclaimed the daughter
at his elbow as soon 08 the latch of
the gate had clicked.

“Lordy, but what have 1 done now?
A young feller’s auto breaks down In
front of the house and we lend him
an ax and tell him he ean have it
again any time. You are always ready
to give buttermilk to tramps, and I
wondered why you didn't come out
and offer him a glnss.. T°don't want
folks to think I've turned stingy in my
old age.”

During the next month Molly
Thatcher heard from the gossips of
the village that the young man wis
connected with the big new factory
five miles awny. She got sight of him
and his nuto at lenst every other dny,
but he peered In vain for her. She
had a maid's curiosity, but she nlso
hand a maid's timidity. At nine o'clock
one moonlight night, as the villige
lights were golng out and a strange
gllence was creeping over the land,
she walked down to .the gate and
leaned upon it. She had not been
standing there ten minutes when the
hum of an auto came to her ears {from
tho crest of the hill a quarter of a
mile away. She had heard that the
dark-haired man sometimes rode about
at night. She would walt until the
machine came nearer and then step
behind a rose bush.

rl heard a sharp soap, and somes
‘thing told her that the auto was com-
ing down the hill uncontrolled. She
sprang through the gate and saw it
coming. There was only one person
fn the vehicle, and intuition and the
moonlight identified him. “The course
was fairly straight, but the brake was
not working. Second by gecond the
speed Increased, and as the machine
came whizzing past she ralsed her

to the man:

killed at the bridge!”
, For the fraction of a second he
looked into her eyes and smiled, and
she had to turn and seize hold of the
gate while she waited for what must
happen at the foot of the hill and the
parrow bridge. And when the crash
came she screamed to her father, doz-
{ng on the porch, and ran screaming
down the path the wild auto had fol-
lowed. When neighbor aroused nelgh-
bor and half a dozen men gathered at
the wreck they found the girl under
the hill sdated on the grass and the
bead of the unconscious young man in
her lap.

“He Is dead!” some of them whis-
pered after a look.

“No! Nol Tt can't be so!” she al-
most flercely,_ replied.

“He must be taken to.the in and a
doctor called.” Fade We x

“No, take him to our honde.. Run

“Cut and bruised and suffering from
the shock, “but no bones broken,” re-
ported the doctor to young Marshall's
friends next ‘morning. “Leave him
fight here and don't worry about
him.” k

Two weeks later, as the young man
was able to ride away in the auto of

before departing:

“I may not want to borrow your ax,

‘Waterplane Piloting.

Describing the difference in the
operation of a waterplane and an air
plane, one pilot sald:

“Piloting a waterplane is slightly
different from piloting! an ordinary
land machine. It is sometimes very
difficult to alight on a choppy sea in

floats, especially if the alighting has to
be done across wind. If the floats do
not ‘land’ simultaneously—that Is, if
one strikes n wave—the result may be
disastrous; a float may be torn'off and
the machine spun {nto theswater. With
a flying boat—which is much more sea-
warthy—there {s not this difficulty.

There is more Catarrh in this sec- |

few years was supposed to be incur-
able, For a great many years doctors
pronounced it a Jocal *discase. apd
prescribed local remedies, and by con-
stantly failing to cure with l6caltreat-
ment, pronounced it incurable, Science
has proven Catarrh to be a consti-
(utional disease, and . therefore re-
quires constitutional treatment. Hall's
