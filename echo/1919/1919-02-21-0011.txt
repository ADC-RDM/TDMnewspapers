“WEAKER AND WISER’
GROWS THE AGE

Years ago men went without underwear,
but vears ago brawn, instead of. brains, did the
work: now its brains that work and bodies must
be protected from the cold, and every day men’
are showing their understanding of wisdom by
investing in Underwear, and this investment .
pays real dividends because next winter the same 5

cost about 50:per cent. more money. All sizes,

"ON GENERAL DISHONESTY

The thing that is at the bottom of
our assessment troubles is dishonesty,”
sald Judge Livingstone, in addressing
a cenvention of county assesors at the
court house in* Welland, last week.
“The . difficulties are created By dis.
honesty of the people themselves, of
the assessors, and of the councils;
and the problem never will be solved
until n honesty is made the su-
preme factor in our machinery of tax-

W IN WINTER,

Good Care Will Improve the Price of
Fleece,

The coming of pence has been look-
ed to by the dealers to produce a
considerable effect on the wool situn-
tion, that is, as regards the manu-
factured material, and it is only to be
expected that the affect produced in
that line will soon find response in
the market for raw material: Tha
consumption of cloth for war pur-
poses will receive a strong check
through the cessation of military ae-
tivities which have entailed so great
on wastage during the past fow years,
even though a great number of men
may await demobilization for a con-
siderable time. The United Staten
has; for some time, been making
ready to export goods to the Argen-
tine, and It is ¢xpected that bottoms
for their trade will be provided al-

most framadidtely, now thal hostili-
ties have ccased. -Tho ships, on their
return voyage, will doubtless brig =
wool An large quantities<for Ameii-
can mills and the opinion of the tr:

is that by the New Year there v

be pleniy.of wool on hand to supdiy
civilian needs in that country.

In considering the possibilities for
prices for {he wool clip next spring,
growers may look forward to a fluc-
tuation on this side of the interna-
tional boundary, in aceardance wzvith
that which takcs place in the Uniiod
States, if one may go on the sireng h
of ‘the point mada by. the fleece wool
demonstration of the Ontario Live
Stock Department at the Canadian
National Exhibition of 1918, namely,
that the price for corresponding
grades of American’ and Canadian
wools brought almost identical
prices, all things considered. With
imports coming freely in the United
States, nothing other than a drop in
price there can be looked for, and it
Canndian prices are to react with tho
American drop'as they acted with the
higher prices, wool growers In Curn=
ada will have to prepare for chang: d
conditions as regards price, by .pay-
ing particular attention to the quai-
ity of their clip so as to ensure (he
securing of the highest price thatda
going when the wool gales take placa
in the summer. * ¥

A very considerable lowering. of
Jast denson’s fleece wool prices could,
no doubt,-be gueeptetl without loss to

| them on the cost, of the sheep and

their upkeep, but.it is to beshoped
that means“ain be devised for keep-
ing the wool price at a level thal
will’ continuesto encoyrage intercst
in sheep raising. The more Important
of .the sheep-raising provinces of Lae
Dominion “ave now better prepencil
than ever before to handle and grade
the clip for growers, who are willing
to co-operate in this work and the
Dominton orginization for the sell-
ing of the graded /flgeces can, pro-
cure for consignors all the price that®
their goods are worth. All that 15
necessary in order that Canadian
waopls may top the market on this
continent Is that the wool growers
themselves makeit a point to pro-
vide good wool, Elean and well pre-
pared, to the graders at the central
stations in the several provinces. Kor
the future, the growers can rest as:
sured that any wool that will come
upito.the top Inthe stdndard of the
several grades, will pay for the extin
effort required to maintain ft int
condition. Now, when sheep .are
about to go into winter quarters, Ii
a“good time to take precaution for
keeping the wool in nice condition.
Good feeding will go a Jong way lo-
ward ensuring satisfactory length
and strength of the fibre and a pro-
perly constructed feed rack will*help
in keeping the fleeces free of objec-
tionahle matter. -
