60 members of the Malden Methodist
church invaded the parsonage and
took ful! posaession of it. They met
to say good-bye to-Mr. and Mrs. Snell,

new home in Dutton. After spending
an hour or two in a social way a
luncheon was served, after which Mr.
and Mrs Snell were called upon to be
seated in the center of the room and
were then made the happy reciplents
of a purse of money. and_a compli-
mentary address, after whicli all sang
ustily “They are jolly good fellows”
and “God be with you till we meet
agaon,” thems all dispersed feeling
that a happy time was spent together,

The Rev. Mr. Snell conducted fare-
