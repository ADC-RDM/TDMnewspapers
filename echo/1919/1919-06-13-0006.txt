Weak, Pale People Require a
Blood-making Medicine.

It took centuries for medical scl-
ence to discover that the blood is the
life. Naw, It {8 known that If the
blood were always abundant, rich
and pure, very few persons would
ever be ill. It was not until the end
of the 19th century that an instru.
ment was invented for measuring the
red part of the blood. Then doctors
could tell just how anaemic a patient
had become, and with medicine to
make new blood the patient soon got
well.

All the blood in the body is nour-
ished and kept rich and red by the
food taken dally, but when, for any
reason, 4 person {8 run down and
cannot make sufficient blood from:
the food to keep the body in health,
then a blood-making medicine {8 re-
quired. The simplest and very best
of blood-makers suitable for home
use by. anyone, is Dr. Williams" Pink
Pills. When a course of these pills
Is taken thelr good effect {8s soon
shown in an improved appetite,
stronger nerves, a sound digestion
and an ability to master your work
and enjoy leisure hours. For women
there i8 a prompt relief of, or pre-
vention of ailments which make life a
burden. Mrs. Thomas Kaake, Tren-
t Ont, 4ells how she obtained new

th and strength through the use
of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. She says:
“The weakness came on me so gradu-
ally that at first it was hardly notier-
able. But after a time it got so that
I cold “mot go up stafrs without
stopping to rest. Every particle of
color left my hands and face, and the
least exertion would tire me and
leave my heart palpitating violently,
I consulted a doctor who told me the
trouble was anaemia and prescribed
a tonic 1 tookvthis medicine for
some time, but it did not seem to |
elp me a bit. Then I read of a cure
in a similar case through Dr. Wil.
llams' Pink Pills, and decided to try
them. The result was these pills
made me feel like a new woman, I
ave gained. all’ my former health
and strength, and feel that I owe my
pre t condition entirely to Dr.
Williams" Pink Pills.”

You can get these pills through
any dealer in medicine, or hy.mail at

GROWING TOBACCO SEED.

That the tobacco plant is one of the
mos susceptible of “all , plants™ to
changes in the spil and climatic con-

s has been conclusively proven
by exp#riments and in actual field
practice. - On the Harrow Tobacco
Staton it hasTbeen found tharfplants
produced from good home grown sded
ripsned earliercand more uniformly
than-those grown*from foreish grown
In view of these fi 1 the
fact that jn -the plist the Mailure of
many tobacco béds, in Canada, could
ter traced directly back to a lack .of
strong, viable se®#l for sowing, ft
would seem advisable for Pach grower
to select a few seed hehds and srow
his own tobacco seed according to hao
most {improved méthods

In selecting seed plants, “the whale
fleld should he gone over several times
before topping and, with a fixed idea
as to the type of plant best suited to
his’ soilband climate andl most desir.
able for his market, the growe: should
select about twice as glany plants as
he requires,™ »Thé plunts selected
should be typical” of the variety of
tobacco grown, early, and vigorous It
is also important to rake Into comnsid-
eration the number, saape,. siz2, and
uniformity of the leaves; thé"tima and
uniformity of ripening,“the number of
suckers» produced, tha color of the
leaves at the time of rip=2piag, and, if
possible, the color of the cured leaves,
After, the preliminary selection, the
field ghiuld be gone over saveral tines
and any plants showing undesirable
characteristics discarded.

Tobacco Is naturally a self-fertiiizal
plant and ordinarily does nnt croas,
However, bees and other insects fly-
ing from ong flower to another will
carry the pollen from one plant to an-
other; and if a poor plant: or one of
another variety should bloom out near
the selected plants there is danger of
them ‘being ¢rossed and the benefit of
the selection loet unless the seed head
is protected In ome way. Just beforé
the first flowers open, each seed head
should be trimmed up until only the
five top branches remain; this insures
the grower obtaining the seed from
the earliest flowers which form, and
the plant -food which would be dis-
tributed over the whole seed head
were |t left untrimmed is reserved for
the development of the earlier pods.
The seed head should then be covered
with a fourteen-pound manflla bag, the
mouth of which ia tied loosely around
the stalk just below the lowest re-
maining branches. About every two
wopks thesé bags should be removed,
alt suckers and late pods broken off,
and the bags replaced. After all of
the seed pods have formed, the bags
should be removed and the pods al
lowed to ripen in the open. This will
cause the seed to ripen earlier and
give a better germination test.

When the greater portion of the
pods have turmed brown, and before
any heavy frost. they ehould be har
vested and hung in-‘a dry place for
about two months to finish ripening

LOSE FAVOR FOR
SERGE AND SATIN

Women Show: Partiality to Fab-
rics That Are More Suitable
to the Season.

SILK JERSEY IN LIMELIGHT

Popular Demand Will Be Met and In-
dications Are That the Mate-
rial May Be Substituted

for Serge.

New York.—The world seems to
have made up Its mind to wear in sum-
mer the clothes that are suggestive of
summer.

This may sound like a familiar con-
dition to women In those sectors of
the country that prepare for the heat
In April and do not think of warm
clothes until November; but in ‘the
large majority of these United States,
observes a fashion writer, there has
been a tendency to dress in summer
in a way that scems to defy the cal-

.

Foulard’ frock, with petticoat and
plaited ruffics of taffeta.

Hundreds of thee women buy
thin serge frocks nnd ‘sults, gowns
with .strong sik *Hnings,” chiffon or
satin bodices that do not wash, and
there Is always n bit of fur hanging
in the closet ready to be used with
or without excuse

There was ‘a-t.me when even the
womensof the cooler states permitted
themselves to look upon lingerie
gowns with favor. This was done In
Paris, where there hos always been a
tendency to avold cool simplicity, even
though July und August demand
clothes that will give comfort. The
avérage Parlgawoman, even though she
may be a young girl working for her
living, never appears In the street or
at a shop In a separate white’ shirt-
walst without a coat, and none of the
Paris women go about the streets in
muslin or linen frocks. It was’ this
French custom in summer clothes that
governed the American output for the
last decade or so,

The woman who 8 watching out for

be warned in time that slie will regret
It If she puts money Into sweaters,

walsts. We are coming into a new
phase of summer clothes. It i8 really
an old, old one, and It has been
brought back through the mental som-
erzault we were compelled to turn dur
Ing the war days. We have a yearn-
Ing for clotires that are sensible. Non-
essentials have rather wearied ‘us.
We think It especially silly to wear a
Ferge gown on wart, moist days‘'when
we could be comfortable In taffeta,

The French designers inaugurated
taffeta as far back as December, and
the American importers offered South-
ern frocks of this material the first of
January. but it was a taffeta that was
a close rival to satin, even thinner and
more comfortable for warm days.

Insistence Upon Silk Jersey. .
No summary of the fubries that are
to flash forth after ihe frost Is over,
18 genuinely good unkss one brings In
jersey. The worsted weave of this
fabric 18 still used, bit the heavy silk
weave, plain or fandtul, Is doing Its
best to come in aheid of the others
on the race track, of fashions. The
“American mills have turned out this
French product with more or less
success. There {8 the drop-stitch
kind, another wegve that has a thick
and a thin square, and still another
that has a twisted and a plain con-
trasting design.

This fabric has taken unto itself the
alr of a conqueror, for it ‘aspires to a
formal place In 8oclety, It appears in
the gulse of an evening gown, not for
formal occaslons, It Is. true, but for
dinner at a restaurant and the theater
afterward. It is handled by the dress-
makers In the same way as satin. It
has long lace sleeves, sometimes a hip
scarf of Spanish lance with a deep,
pendant panel In front; agaln, it has
an upper bodice of white chiffon with
square Spanish sleeves to match, It Is
used for coat sults and offers itself as
n rival to Shantung, for It does not
wrinkle easily. It comes in the ma-
Jority af good colors, and In belge und
biscuit it still flows along at high
tide, .

It is felt, more than.sald, that eatin
may have had its day as a spring fab-
ric. There Is a strong tendency away
from {t, just as there Is from serge.
No one who dabblessnmong clothes can
fall to notice this avoidance of the two
fabrics in orders for new frocks.
Satin Is still good for evening, but it
Is draped with chiffon or tulle, When
brilliant colors are used, ns In one of
the new gowns named after General
Pershing, American beauty red satin
Is veiled In an oriental manner with
long festoons of mauve chiffon, each
corner. welghted with an amethyst
necklace that drops to the knees in
front, outljnes the sharply cut decol-
letage over the shoulders and drops in
two straight lines belong the walst at
the back, each end finished with a
tassel of theumethyst. This type of
gown Is chosen everywhere among
smart people, when satin Is used, It

As for serge, exactly what the pnb-
