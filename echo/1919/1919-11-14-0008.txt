O well known as to have become a

Canadian institution is this grand f
working Pandora.

 

Glass oven door; tested thermorheter; an oven

so evenly heated that even the beginner can

bake well with it. Grates work smoothly;

reservoir is enameled and may be removed
. for cleaning. e

There is a lifetime of satisfaction in the
Pandora.
