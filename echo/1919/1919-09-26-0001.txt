DESTRUCTIVE HAIL STORM.

An equinoctial gale of unprecedent-
ed wiolence In this locality, swept over
Bsgex county Saturday night. It was
accompanied by a hailstorm which cut
a swath some two miles wide, run-
ning northeasterly with Amherstburg
on the southern boundary, and left a
great deal of destruction In its wake,
To ‘make matters worse, the Hydro
flashed out within a few munttes after
the storm started, throwing the town
into. darkness, and Saturday ‘night
shopping was alther abandoged or ac-
complished undeér very adverse. con-
ditions. ‘The streets swam with wat-
er, but as soon ms the gitters and
catch basing were cleared out,” the
sewer system took care of that. The
three station transformers = of the
Windsor’ Hydro system with a capac-
ity ‘of 3,000 horsepower were so badly
damaged that the whole county’ sys-
tem was cut off and service was-not
restored until Sunday morning.

| NO CONSERVATIVE

IN SOUTH ESSEX

South Essex Conservatives announce
officially that they will not put up
candidate in the coming Provincia
elections. This fs no news. when M.
C. Fox: who had bees promised the
Conservative nomination, accepted the
nomination of the U. F. 0. anyone
who had even a primary education in
politics could figure that there would
be no Conservative candidate.

~ PRESENTATION.

Tuesday afternoon two of the pupils
of St, Rose's school, Amherstburg,
were the grateful recipients of two
valuable prizes, Rev. Fr. Kennedy be-
ing the encouraging and generous don-,
or, presented Miss Marion Kelly with
a ten-dollar gold pjece, as shie had the
honor of standing highest In the recent
Entrance examination. Miss Mar-
garet Funston came second in rank,
and recefved five dollars in gold. Sis-
ter Superior showed her appreciation
by being present, and all the students
of the Continuation Class were unani-
ous in congratulating their sugcess-
ul class-mates. /

MEDAL PRESENTATION.

The committee in charge of the pre-
sentation of medals to Amherstburg
soldiers has arranged to have this {m-
portant event take place in the park,
in front of the grand stand, next
Tuesday afternoon at 2 o'clock, just
before the baseball game is called.
The. presentation has been delayed
expecting to get General Sir Arthur
Currie for the occasion, but as lt fs
impossible to arrange a date with him
until: his return from British Colum-
bia some time in November, the com-
mittae did not feel llke delaying the |;
matter that long. As over sixty of the
flower of Amherstburg's young men
will be recipients of medals. this will
be a very important occasion in the,
higtory, of the town and a feature of
the second day of the Fair worth
while. Major-General Shannon, 0. C.
Military District“ No. 1, London, Has
been requested to make the presenta-

In the course of passionate pleas for
the restoration of alcohol to a place of
pre-eminence in the lifeé.of this Pro-
vince, some. Liberty League orators |
have no hesitation to hurl insults at
the majority of civilian citizens. Not
content with this style of campaign-
ing, evidence is néw Yurnfghed that
thousands of soldiers are’ to Hei the
subject of slurs and aspersion§ that
could be bréd. only where liquor inter-
ests are considered as of more jmport-
ance than the prosperity and general
good of the community. i

The Border Cities Star of Friday,
September 10th, (n reporting the pro-
ceedings connected - with the) ostab-
lishm@nt of & new branch of the Lib
erty ‘LGengue at Amherstburg, devotes
dome space to an address by Mr. Ern-
e¢st Raymond, described as “a rapre-
sentative of the G. W. VI" A, In Walk-
erville;” and quotes him in pari as fol
lows: ’

“l was In France for several
years, I saw that the man over
there who did not drink or smoke
wasithe fisst to turn coward when |
the whiz bangs began flopping In"
to the trench. He didn't have thes,
nerve to drink or smoke for, fear
the habit would get him, and con-
sequently his moral fibre had nev-
er been toughened.” “
Such a contemptible. libel of thou- §

sands of brave men, many of whom
died for the great cause, might well
have heen left to others than a re- |
turned soldier; but the pleaders for’
strong drink seem to be. capable of
indulging in all kids of unworthy
and ludjcrous assertions.” —The Globe.
