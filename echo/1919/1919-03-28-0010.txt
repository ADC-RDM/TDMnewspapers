NEW CANADIAN CENT.

that

awhich
der
led

The historic GC cent
has been in circu i
ation, is to disappear, be supe
by a small coin similar'to the
can. Sir Thomas White introduc
®ill to accomplish this end. He
plained that the ~hange was being
made owing to the clumsy nature of
the present legal tender. A sugges-
tion was’ made by Sim Herbert Ames
that there should be a two-cent.piece.
Sir Thomas thought that-for the pres-
ent this Was unnecessary.

Sir Thomas sald that thé present coin
weighs eighty pennies to the pound,
while the new coin will ron 140 to the
pound. It will approximate the Amers
fcan bronze cent, which “weighs 48
gains It will‘be a little lighter than
the 10-cent silver piéce and figure so
that it will be easily distimgnished by
the touch.

The old one-cent piece will continue
fn force and the new one will be. is
sued by proclamation.

Sir Thomas explained that it was not
intended to withdraw the present one-
cent plece from circulation,” but as
they became smooth and worn they
would be redeemed. This would take
a long time

Mr. Jacobs suggested that the new
coins should be more distinctively
Canadian than those at present.

\ WINDSOR.

“Mayor Winter has been informed by
President Campbell, of the Windsor &

will not allow Windsor to make an

audit of its books to convince the city’

that the company is losing money.
When representatives of the ferry com-
pany and city met here several weeks
ago the audit and eight tickéts for a
quarter were the only bones of conten-
tion. City officials took the position
that the price of fares should be put

. back to ten tickets for a quarter, un-

of its

will not take the company’s word, and

discussed and such information given
as will be a guide to farpuers in select
ing the varieties to sow this spring.
After a general discussion of the var
feties the best kinds ame arranged. ap-
proximately in the order of merit for
the different parts of Canada. Wheats
