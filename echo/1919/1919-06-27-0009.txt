the citizenship of Mr. Irwin, who was

Rev. Mr. Connor preached an elo-
quent sermon last Sunday afternoon
from the text: “Remember the Sab-
bath day and keep it holy,” and show-
ed clearly the manner in which the
Sabbath of to-day is being desecrated,
reminding of the old bible teaching of
the punishment that will come to a
nation that robs the Lord of His day,
and the root of the matter begins in
the home life, then extends to the na-
tional life.’ Let us take warning.
