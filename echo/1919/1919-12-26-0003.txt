Investigation of “Enchanted Table"
in New Mexico Seems to Bear Out
Story Long Belleved.

An Isolated butte riging out of n vast
plain In the vast Southwest—a flat-
topped hill 430 feet high and with
sldes so nearly vertical that for many
centuries it wns supposed to be hope-
lessly ellmb-proof, 18 one of the most
interesting of the natural wonders of
this part of the United States.

Many attempts to climb the *“En-
chanted Table” or “Mesa Encantnda,”
08 the first Spanish settlers called It,
have been made, but Indian supersti-
tion has attributed thelr fallure Inrge-
ly to n supernatural Influence that
balked the nscent. Hence the name

Cll In cealed
packages.

    

According to the Indian legend, the

of the well-known Acoma pueblo, In
New Mexico, was very anclently the
site of a prehistoric village. A fright-
ful storm carried away part of the
rock and with It the rocky staircase
which offered the only path of necess
to the summit,

As n result, the people in the village
were cut off from the plain below.
They could not climb down; no help
could reach them, and they starved to
death. The only survivors were a few
who by chnnce were absent from the
mesa top at the time of the disaster.
From them, It Is explained, ure sprung |
the present-day Inhabitants of the pu-

¢blo of Acoma.

But science, while disposed to ‘be |
incredulous of things unproved, Is at
the same time inclined to Investiga-
tion. Hence an expedition which the
government burenu of ethnology sent
out to climb the Mesa Enenntada. The
party, after almost incredible “efforts,
arrived upon the top.

What they expected to find was—
nothing.. But, to thelr surprise, they
discovered, on the summit of the mesa,
plain and unmistakable evidences of
ancient oceupaney, such, as ruined
walls, and- what they snw there af-
forded a mensurable confirmation of

the Indian legend.
