ONTARIO HOUSING REGULATIONS

    
 

 

Promulgated by J. A, Ellis Under the
Regulations of the New Act.

LOANS FOR FARMERS.

Regulations: under the Ontario
Housing Act, which became law a few
days aga, were promulgated last week
by J. A. Ellis, Director ‘of the Bureau
of Municipal Affairs. These provide
that In ,2 municipality. which has
building by-laws all houses shall be
erected in accordance with the re-
structions, provided that the minimum
requirements regarding general pro-
visions and housing standards of the
Province shall take precedence over
the provisjons of the building by-laws
of municipalities where, such provis:
sions fall below tHe mimimum re quire-
ments and housing standards -of the
province. It is also provided that a
house erected under the provision of
the Act shall not be converted into a
store or used for any purpose other
than a dwelling, except with the ap-
proval of the Municipal - Housing
Commission,

Special regulations had to be made
for farmers who desire fo avail them-
selves of thé Act, as they may bor-
row direct from the Government, and
not through thé Municipal Commis-
sions. Before making applications to

“the Director for a loah a farmer must

designate and set. aside a piece of
good agricultural land, not less thin
one acré in extent, immediately ad-
jncént to the Proposed dwelling house,
for the use of the occupant of such
dwelling house. ; Plans,
and an estimate of the cost of con-
struction must be submitted to the
Director for approval.

A farmer obtaining’ a loan must

give a first mortgage on the ‘whole of | ghoes on.

his farm to the Commission as secur-
fy. With the apppoval of’ the Direc-
tor, however, such mortgage may be
given upon part of the farm. _ Like-

tor, a second mortgage ‘may ba’ given
upon the whole farm,

The mortgage must contain coven-
ants by the farmer to keep the house
in reppir and to pay taxes and other

rates of Insurance. i

of the fourth-year girls irritated him

They were just silly, thoughtless girls,

Without exaggeration Cynthia was
the worst girl he had ever had under

seemed to be tostorment the professor

turned up for her to argue about or
