ported tlie scheme for Malden
as Iald out jn March on the ground
that {t would serve most people
through Malden. Thé Pike already be-
ing a good road, could ba kept up
with little’ expense and maintained as
a good highway. R. Atkin, reeve of

mittee it would be worked out satis-
factorlly. He contended that had
there been no fight on with, Windsor
over the Suburban Area that.By-law
No. 374, designating the first County
Good Roads, would have been amend-

ed, and Inferred that this discussion,

would not then have been necessary.

A general discussion then took place
in which it came out that under thé
present layout Anderdon
have aligtted to it eight miles more of
good roads than it js entitled to ac-
cording ta fts equalization, the ays-
tein being une mile for every $100,000
assessment.

Several Compromise schemes were
suggested, Gne being to eltminate the
Anderdon  townline and adopt the
Pike and fithers, but the Anderdon
reave and Councillors, though. willing
to’be mMOri- than fair, felt that by
the time the good road® would be built |.
that {he Anderdon equalization would
have heen increased sufficiently to ¢n-
tile them tothe additional elght |
miles,
