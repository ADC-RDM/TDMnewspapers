by that.

The eve.of the dny when the an-
nouncement«of the plans was to be
made came at last, and Lucy had the
first big story ready to send to the lit-
tle Sentinel press. There was ev n to
be a cut showing the design fo the
fountain. And it had all ‘been kept a
secret between Mrs Pell -and Lucy,
though people were beginning to won-
der why there had been surveyors and

Jrarkmen on the old picnie grounds of

The Sentinel was just golng to press
and Luey was putting the lost’ flour-
Ishes on the great! announcement in
the dingy little office long after. other
good Pelltonites had retired for the
night. The ownerteditor, ‘un errand
boy, the other reporter andia’handfal
of compositors and pressmen consti-
tuted the entire staff, and they were
too preoccupied with their tasks to no-
tice. the figure of Francis Pell as ft
passed quickly across thé floor to
Lucy's desk. He sat down beside her,
lald, a nervous hand on: the copy she
was still working on, “There's hitch

had finished her work,

“It's this way,” he began. “Men
from the water department have been
feeling around lately, and today I got
0 notice from headquarters, That
spring Isn't n spring at all, It's a leak
from the main. . That water is fist the

along In silence for a few minutes,

“| Pell tried to begin his next speech be-

fore he sudceedad.

“I was thinking,” he sald, “n fact,
I've, thought it for a long time—ever

front from Pellton much more of a

might have made her appeal In an-
other way, But the fact was that Mr.
Francis Pell, whose , ancestors “had
founded the old town, was quite as
much of a character In hi§ way as was
ether the toothless Silas Snell or the
little spinster who had “always kept
the cent shop.” Although scarce forty,
and although no one hand ever seen
him counting out bags of money, nor
had he ever been known to be crafty
or shrewd In money matters, he was
regarded as “the old miser.” There
were fabulous accounts of the extent
(of the Pell fortune, which had once
glittered large In the mind's eye of
Pellton mammas, but had long since
ceased to be regarded as In any way
available. . =

So: Lucy pald her first call on Mr.
Pell. and was very politely shown ‘to
the*door aftef she had made herself
quite clear, “ind she went away feel-
Ing “a8rmuch éonfused and disheart-
ened as she had some seven years be-
fore, when she went out an her first
assignment for the big city paper. For
Lucy was not n native Pelltonite, If
she had been she would have known
better than to try to make news out
of anything that Francls' Pell might be
doing. But she knew he, was one of
the most gossiped about personalities
in town. Falling to find* anything
more fertile for discussion about him,
the women discussed the size of" his
[Erocer bills—though they were  per-

fectly normal—or kept close track of
I'nis harmless old mammy housekeeper
{or the new coat of paint on his house
or the condition'of his apple orchard.
‘But these things wouldn't make news
Items gor the Sentinel.

Lucy was rebuffed the first time, po-
litely but effectively, and went away
perhops more upset over a certain
griclous courtesy that Mr. Pell had
shown toward her than because of the
actual rebuff a

‘But Lucy hand not been a reporter

other. She would get some sort of

Lucy chose to take him entirely sent
ously. “Make some gift to the tows,”
she announced. “Every one thinks you
