The binder !8 the best machine to
use If the cloXer Is heavy and stands
up well: when cutting with the
binder the cord should be removed
and the sprin¥% slackened so that the
binder “will t¥ip continuously, The
binder has t¥o boards to hold the
sheaf, which boards should be
sluckened also In order to allow (he
clover a free course to the ground.
In dropping to the ground, the clover
will’ not shell and will be light so
that the wind and sun can easily dry
it out. The windrow will be out of
the way of the horses and machine
i| and can be easily gathered with the
barley fork.

As to the length of time the clover
should be allowed to remain in the
windrow, this will depend on the
weather and on the, condition fn
which the clover is cut. Sometimes
it must remain two or three weeks.
It is not wise, however, to allow the
straw to become black and ruined
for fodder, Just as soon as it is
well cured it should be gathered
in.

Threshing appears to be the prob-
lem to solve. Farmers who have
threshers of any kind can overcome
this difficulty to a certain extent.
Clover seed may be threshed with
the two-horde tread power, with the
large"steamr grain thresher and with
the clover huller.

With the grain thresher it is a
slow process, as the short material
has to be put through twice In order
that #11 the seed may be separated
from the hull." There are slight ad-
justments to be made tothe machine.
If Jt is desired to save the clover
straw for fodder it is best toirun the
clover: through the machine in the
| same way as grain. The first run
through will separate all the heads
