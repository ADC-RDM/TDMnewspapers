SHRIVELED WHEAT DUE
TO GRAIN DISEASE

Does your wheat have many shriv-
eled grains in It? Shriveled grains
are an indication that plant diseases
are probably present in the grain and
that such grain should not be nsed for
fall seeding, unless recleaned and
treated, according to botanists at the
Ohio Experiment Station. Anthrac-
nose and wheat scab, which have been
quite prevalent in Ohio grain fields
during the past year, both cause grain
to ‘shrivel, the shriveled kernels con-
taining the spores 6f the disease,

Wheat containing a small per cent.
of shriveled grain may be run through
a fanning mill before seeding. thus re-
moving spores of infection from the
clean wheat. It Is also advisable'to
treat the grain for these diseases, and
methods of treating seed wheat may
be secured by writing to the Experi
ment Station at Wooster. The use of
a good crop rotition is also essential
in combatiing wheat troubles,

COMBATTING THE

TOBACCO HORN WORM

i —

(By D. D. Digges, Supt. Harrow To-
bacco Station.)

In wiew of the appearance in large
numbers of various other insects, this
season, which have caused the tobac-
co grower wonsiderable loss and trou-
ble he may safely expect large num-
bers of tobacco horn. worms to con.
tend with, and should equip himsels
early for combatting this pest.

Iu the pmst, the method 1nost. fre-
quently resorted to was picking (em
off by hand. However, this is a very
expensive method and not a very ef-
ficient one; for often numerous smail
worms and eggs are left which do an
enormous amount of damage to the
leaves before being removea.

Spraying tobacco with either ar-
senate of lead’or Paris greca is the
most e¢ficctive and economical method
for controlling the horn worm. By
spraying not only are all worms thea
on the tobacco killed but also all that
hateh within a week or ten days af*er
spraying

For tkis purpose avsenmate of lead

THE PROPORTION OF »

In Flue-Cured Tobacco.

(H. A: Freeman—Tobacco Inspector)

The stripped leaf and stalks from
twenty-four plots each year. for the
past .two' years ere welghted ins or
led yto determine if any co-relations
of leaf to stalk could be noted. “Grow-
ing, topping and harvesting waskdone
as {8 practiced by the growers of the
flue-cured district.

The percentage of leaf to stalk was
very close each year for all plots re-
gardless of the fertilizer applied, for
the ylelds obtained.

acre but the proportion of stalk io
leaf remained practically the same.

The Warne and Hickory Pryor var-
fetles were grown in these experi:
ments, The percentage of stalk to
leaf remained practically constant for
both varfeties, .

In no case did a plot show less than
50% of stalk to leaf, nor mwre than
60 %2 *, Most of the plots ware very
close to the average of 650.2%; s0rHH2
pounds of stalks to each 1,000 pounds
of cured leaf.

ware conducted is typlenl of the dis-
trict In’ physical and chemical)” char-
acter and composation.

“In the flue-cared belt of the South.
ern States, Davidson found the per-
centage of stalk to leaf to be 35.2% or
362 pounds of stalks to each 1,000
pounds of cured leaf. .

By comparing 3562 pounds of stilk
for each 1.000 pounds of flue-cured to-
bacco produced in the South with 552
pounds of stalk for each 1,000 pounds
of flue-cured tobacco leaf produced in
Canada, it is seen that an extra 200
pounds of stalk to each 1000 pounds of
