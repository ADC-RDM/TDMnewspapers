pairing at hoe means sav-

Ing In two ways—a gaving of expense |
.und a saving of time,

Before attempting to take a ma-
chine apart it {8 well to thoroughly
look over®ft.to gain a clear idea of
the general arrangement and location
of the parts, Machines with few
parts or parts .whose relations are
quite obvious, do not require to be

marked, but machines whose parts
nre numerous and similar in size and
in appearance should be given dis-
tinclive marks—similar marks being
put on adjoining parts. Thede marks
may. be centre-pops arranged in de-
vides fio: LL, tl, PL, or letters
stnmped upon surface of the parts
where there is no frictional contact.

In the stress of a busy season a
broken tooth of a gear can be fixed
up in a few minutes, and if properly
done gears so repaired will often last
an Indefinite time—often many years,
Chip and file the broken tooth down
to the root. Draw centre line of
tooth across width of rim. Drill the
required number of holes, according
to width of rim. A pin of wrought
iron stock may be driven gently into
the holes and filed to shape to match
the other teeth. A better job may
be made by tapping the plugs into the
rim (Fig. 6).

To mend harness by sewing pro-
cure a couple of strong needlgs, a ball
of high-grade flax shoe th#fead (No.
8), a ball of cobbler's wax? a straight
and bent awl, and a clamp to hold
the work. The clamp can be made
from two oak barrel staves (Fig. 1).
The thread should be made in length
and strength according to the work
to be done. For light work from 3
to five strands will suffice, for me-
dium, like lines and girths, from 6
to 8 strands; and for heavy stitching,
as tugs and breeching, it will require
from 9 to 16 strands,

Break the -thread by rubbing ft
down upon your ‘knee, with your
right hand, and give it a sudden jerk.
It should break in a long ragged end:
The ends should be placed together
80 as to form a long tapened point.
Hold" strands together in your left
hand. With wax in right hand draw
it over the ends a few times, enough
to keep them together. Now throw
strands over a nail, draw ends even,
twine the end in left hand over .fore-
finger, and rub the othér end down
on the right knee with the right
hand. When well twisted rub on
more wax. Thread a needle on each
end, draw the thread through the
eye for about two inches. Bend back
the points of the thread and twist
them well into the body of the thread
(Fig. 1a).
