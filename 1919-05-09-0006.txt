Open Your Surface Drains,

Drainage—either surface or under-
ground—Is essential if farming is to
be profitable. With the dearth of |
ditching ' machinery, the depleted |
Jabour market nd the increased cost |
of underdraining, progress Is re- |
tarded somewhat, Everything, how:
ever, has been done which provalling |
conditions permit. Yet, fortyiFper |
cont (40%) of Ontarlo is in urgent
need of drainage, The underdrainage
of so much cannot be accomplishad
in a short period of time, hence that |
which renders timely service, even
though only of temporary duration,
must be taken advantage of.

Surface draining must be resorted
to. Several limes will be necessary,
Indeed, it the majority of farmers |
would-leave all “finishing” furrows
open in the ploughed ground and
connect them, by opening up cross
channels through the lower-lying
parts: of the field—cleaning out all
the furrows thus traversed—a system
Swould ‘be formed whereby the water
could be carried to outlets, quickly,
efficiently jand satisfactorily in the
early spring. 2 J

Not along to. leve] fields or farms
does this apply. Large areas of On-
tario are quite rolling, lence natur-
ally draiped. Yet, ‘a small open
ditely or deep furrow Wilt pay for the
frouble netessayy 1o muke a ¢hannel
by the greater eage with which water
can escape, thus permitting quicker
| disposal of the same, hence hastening
the, drying of the fand. ~~ +

These surface drains should be
opened at least once per year. The
best time to do so is In the ate
autumn after the fall work is done.
Labour can be obtained then with
less. difficulty “and” at less cost, The
work miy be done by hand or by the
usd of a team if watér does not
prevent, 3

Surface draining, however, is not
recommended, to take the -place of
tiling.—Thos.~ Cooper, B.S.A,, O. A.

Starting Early Celery.

The starting of early celery shonld
be done immediately as the seed is

about % an inch in the box and then
the celery is sown broadcast gyer it.
The box is then watered through bur-
ley and is left covered with burlap

nates. When the plants are showing
1wo or three leaves they are trans-
planted into flats, 2 inches cach way
