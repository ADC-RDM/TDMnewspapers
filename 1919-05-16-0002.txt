~The Easiest Way
To Invest |

Canada, following the example of other
Allied countries, has made it possible
for wage earners—men and women—
to invest in safe securities without effort.

These securities are called War Savings
Stamps.

The cost now $4.04, but by compound-
ing interest, the $4.04 you invest now
will be worth $5.00 in 1924. There is
no other security in which you can in-
vest such a small amount that is as safe

in May
and that bears so high a rate of interest.

W-S.S.

Cost $4.04 5
Or you can start with 25 cents, by buy-

ing a Thrift Stamp. When you have
sixteen Thrift Stamps, you can exchange
them for a War Savings Stamp.

You take no risks. The Government

of Canada guarantees to pay you back
your money — with interest — at any

time during the five years, or to pay you
in 1924 $5.00 for every $4.00 (and a
fraction) you invest now. :

In June
W-S.S,

Cost $4.05
