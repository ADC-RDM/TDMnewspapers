YOING man who wishes to
mak a name for himself and
littk or no money could
hardy choose a more prom-

{sing carcerthan that of voleanolog-
ist, accordin: to Calvin Frazer, writ-
ing In Pomlar Selence Monthly.
“There are brillant discoveries to be
made and ti field Is not a bit
crowded,”

However, the aspiring voleanolog-
{st must, we barn, be In possession
of certain atributes before he can
hope to atuin success. These are
“an aptitude for scientific research,
the physique to endure rough mouns

taineering amd the courage to face
the risk of bang engulfed in the fiery
lava,"

Touching pon the general lack of
kpowledgd fi regard to volcanoes
Mr. Frazer says: "Our grandfathers
knew a grat deal more about vol-
canoes than we do, but what they
knew was early all wrong. They
declared thut» the intepior of the
globe was © ‘molten mass.’ It is
almost certsinly a dense solid, mora
rigid than steel.” And the facts
which prove this, he says, are “its
weight (as determined by astrono-
mers), the way it transmits earth-
quake waves, the resistance it offers
to the distorting effect of the sun's
and the moon's attraction, ete. But
the interior of the earth, as far as
we can determine, is go intensely hot
that if at any place far below the sur-
face the stupendous crushing force
of: the rocks above is, by any means,
somewhat reduced, the solid must
change to a liquid, or even a gas.”

How earth tides cause eruptions is
thus described:

“Various circumstances
bring about an ex:
pressure here and
time to time. The
shrinking as it‘cools; and its surface
is warped Into fol( and creases,
Moreover, there arc regular tides in
(he earth's crust—a rise and fall of
about a foot, on average, twice a
day. These things caus variations
in pressure underng ath, and the melt-
ing of deep-seated rocks probably
takes place on a vist scale. - It i8

the presence of steam. Specimens of
voleanie gas collected in the crater
of Kilauea puniped. from the lava
into collecting tubes withdnd camming
in contact with ghe air were found
to be heavily charged with steam.
“Can the eruptions of other. yol-
canoes be predicted? If so, then vol-
canology is one of the most fuiport-
ant of the sciences in terms of hu-
man welfare. This praetical problem
is not yet fully solved, but it Is in
