CONSTANT PAIN
AFTER EATING

The Tortures of Dyspepsia
Gorrected by “Fruit-a-tives”

Sr. Marmix's, N.B.

“For two years, 1 suffered tortures
from Severe Dyspepsia. I had
*constant pains after eating; pains
«down the sides and back ; and
horrible bitter stuf often came up
in my mouth.

I tried doctors, but they did not
help me. But as soon as I started
taking ‘Fruil-a-tives’, 1 began to
improve and this medicine, made
of fruit juices, relieved, me when
everything else failed.”

|FARM WATER SYSTEMS

A Summary of Best Available
Types for Stables.

When Pastures Fail the Milk Flow
Decreases Unless Solling Crops
Have Been Provided — Corn
Silnge Will Also Greatly Increase
Milk Yield In Hot Summer.

(Contributed by Ontario Department of
Agriculture, Toronto.)

N a day's visit amongrthe farmers

of Ontario In almost every
county you would run across
quite a number of stables equip-

ped with some form or other of
water system for supplying the form
stock more or less automatically with
water each day. With few exceptions
every new barn built now is pro-
vided with a water system, Among
the available systems are the follow-
ing, which, in this short article, can
recelve only a very brief description:
Of these probably the most com-
mon {8 that consisting of a water sup-
ply tank in the hay or straw loft
above the stable, from which the
water runs by gravity into a regnlat-
ing tank on the stable floor, which
supplies the individual drinking
basins with water automatically. The
tank is usually built of concrete and
the size depends upon the kind of
power used for pumping; If windmill

be used then the tank needs to be
large enough for three or four days’
supply as the wind does not blow
every day. |Under these conditions
a tank 10 x 4 x 4 feet, or {ts equiva-
lent would be required for 30 head
of stock, Sometimes the concrete
tank is built just outside the stable
wall and underground enough to pro-
tect it again frost, or in one corner
of the stable, elevated enough oft
the floor to feed the regulating tank
by gravity. In case pumping is done
by gasoline engine and a smaller
tank is sufficient, a metal one Is sus-
pended from ceiling of stable. In
every case an overflow is necessary.
Muny provide means for collecting
the rain water off the barn and run-
ning it into the storage tank so that
in wet weather very little pumping is
required, especially where a large
tank is used. Another method of
filling the storage tank Is by the
hydraulic Tam installéd at the spring.
Still another is by means of a ona-
inch pipe. leading {rom a spring or
other source at an elevation at least
as high as the storage tank, Some-
ti where hydraulic ram ‘or grav-

ystem Is In use the storage tank
is dispensed with, the water, in the
case of the former, running through
the drinking basins or trough all the
time and escaping to a good outlet
or drain, in the latter the water is
piped directly to the regulating tank
which in turn supplies the basins or
trough automatically. Again the
water is pumped direetly to tank in
the attic of the house, and the over-
flow from .it supplies the stable with
water. And‘since the advent df the
compression water system we find a
few cases where it is used to supply
the stables as well as the house, the
installation being - proportionately
larger than it would befor the house
alone.” Probably no one system, how-
ever, can be absplutely recommended
as best for every case as. the cir-
cumstances pertaining to the source
of supply, amount of water (sad,
position and ‘elevation of the farm
buildings, etc., always have to he
carefullysconsidered jo. planning the
ideal water system foisthe farmehouse,
or stable.—R., R.‘ Graham; B.S.

Soiling: Crops for Cows.

Most Ontaado dairy farmers depend
on the pasture«erop for the fdeding
of cows during strmmer. “If the pas-

and the whole dalry business is more

That's why workers love onitmeal. That's
