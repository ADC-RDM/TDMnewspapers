young Women, who somehow sent |

strange thrills coursing through one's
veins when she felt one's pulse, and
for lack of a stethoscope she had to
lny her golden-crowned little head
agninst his heart for full three min-
utes at a time to find out the state
of that organ. But, anyway, there
were advantages In this new embar-
rassment. © At least she was taking
him serlously—even though she re-
celved a fee for doing so—and that
was more than any woman had done
since the encampment was cktablished
near Murden, She told him that he
surely did need treatment, but that
she would have'to think the matter
over before she could prescribe,

Aleantime Paul went home encour-
aged and Doctor Kate cultivated the
acquaintance ‘of Paul's sister and
mother. She hand suspected something
and she found it to be true. Then she
lald out a plun for a cure and pro-
ceeded to apply It. But the cure did
not come in any pill boxes or medicine
bottles. The first dose was an lnvl-
tation to dinner at her house, on the
pretext of meeting her mother, And
Doctor Kate watched with satisfac
tion that was not all’ professional as
he accepted-his fifth muffin—they were
made with ns much wheat as the Hoo-
ver regulation allowed—and watched
him eat the dessert to make which she
and her mother had foregone sugar
for two days. - Doctor Kate had a won-
derful waydof finding things out, for
Paul himself never told her about his
socks. But before many weeks had
passed«he was actually bringing his
socks stealthily «to Doctor Kate's
mother, who assured him she had a
perfect passion for darning, and since
her own boy had gone to the foent she
had had none to do.

Then Kate prescribed some sort of
clectrical treatment for her patient
that had to be administeced every
morning In her office before breakfast,
and she also assured him that the good
effects-of the treatment would be off-
set If he went out afterward without
ecuting. Having breakfast with Doc-
tor Kate and her mother therefore be-
came part of the treatment.

And Paul recovered rapidly. He re-
zained the lost pounds, and presently
Nis case was spoken of as a feather
{n the cap of Doctor Kate Pratt,. Gos-
sip had It that he was In an actual
decline’ when she took him in hand.
No ong knew just what the treatment
hind been, but it had required many,
mnny visits, and the fee that wus
handed over to the Red Cross is a
rzault was enough to buy all the yarn
that Marden women could knit up In
1 year.

And the funny thing was that when
Paul sued for Doctor Kate's™ heart
ands hand and gained them both Mar-
den women folk were a little peeved,
even to Paul's own mother and sister.
“It's always that: way with eligible
men,” was the comment. © “The girls
in the home town can pet them and
pamper them for years, but the first
nice girl from out of town is the one
they marry." i

For Marden failed to see: how. piil-
fully susceptible Paul Dedham had bes |
come a8 a result of the neglect he had
suffered.
