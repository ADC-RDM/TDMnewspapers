Late George Ww, Russell,
A Prince of Anecdotists

b Stiries of Famous Men
Ra a aa anna
HE late Gorge W. E. Russell
was known {n Britain as a

prince of anecdotists,” In
one book lie recalls the
Duke of Wellington saying that he
had “been much exposed to

authors”; all his long life Russell
was much exposed ( the great men

and employed lis opportunity well.
When James Pays was dying he used
to visit him to relell amusing stories
characteristic of hose he had met,
and the veteran journalist advised
him to make a bank of them. *Col-

lections and Recollections,” of 1898,
was followed by i long list of titles.
In his last yolume Russell entertain-
ingly proved that he had been ac-
quainted with every Premier since

Journalists, schoolmen, clerics, have
left us long shelves interesting chief-
ly for anecdotes of the personages of
the day. Of those who founded their
fame on Virgilium tantum vidi, none
deserved it more than Russell.

A good story Is its own excuse for
being, But one service of writers
like Russell is that they give us an
intimate, informal view of characters
who otherwise would be seen only
as on dress parade. Anecdotists like

badgered him for leave to visit the

Anecdotists who take théir craft
seriously may well comtribute to so-
cial history, as Pepys unconsciously
and Greville consciously did. Russell
had a careful regard to the illustra-
tion of” traits of his’ ume, and de-
veloped in his essays a commentary

Russell furnishes a multitude of {l-
lustrations of the changes he gladly
triced to the Evangelical movemeht,
popular education, ,and great re-
formers.
The born anecdotist is far rarer
even than the dinper-table
| raconteur. The latter may be as-
sisted by expansive geniaNty, infec-
tious good humor, or other personal
trait, not to say by the wine. The
former must submit to all the eva-
poration of aroma from his stories
produeed by cold print and lapse of
time. Russell spoke of his ‘“‘apec-
dotage” as if age and experience were
needed for the art; the most infall-
ible good taste assuredly is—a taste
that drags nothing in by the leecls,
takes no liberties, and never runs in-
